<!--
Note: the pagination uses a very similar structure, but doesn't use this class due to the button directions.
Yes I don't feel like making this class compatible with images right and left right now.

<a class="button is-primary" href="{{ include.link }}" target="_blank">
    <span class="icon has-text-danger">
      <i class="{{ include.icon | default: 'fa-solid fa-info' }}"></i>
    </span>
  <span class="has-text-danger">{{ include.text }}</span>
