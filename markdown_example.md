# Title

I am some **bold** and *italic* text. I am `code` or a `filename`.

## Header 1

- List item
- List item 2
- List item 3

### Header 2

[Link to article same category](article-name)
[Link to a different article category](../characters/character-name)

#### Header 3

You can use any image already hosted online by using a URL.

![Alt text for the image](ONLINE-LINK)

If you need to add new screenshots, they will have to be uploaded by someone before
you can use them on the wiki. There is currently no automated process for this, sorry!

You can re-use existing images or newly added images by using:

![Alt text makes the wiki more accessible!](../Resources/folder/filename.extension)

#### Header 4

You can't use video, sadly! But you can use unicode characters, like emojis and some symbols (https://home.unicode.org/).

##### Header 5

You can also use blocks for quotes, code or literal transcriptions.

```
I am a block that will ignore any of the symbols used in Markdown.
