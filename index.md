content="Welcome to the Bring Me The Horizon ARG Wiki! We are here to help you get started." 
%}


This wiki centers all around the mysteries around the album [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn](pages/music/ph-nex-gen). 
The Alternate Reality Game, or ARG, is currently still developing and so are [we](pages/about). Our team will 
try to regularly update the website and improve the look and experience. This wiki will focus on objective 
information as much as possible and indicate whenever something is not confirmed.

***

## Getting started

There is a lot going on in this ARG! We get it if you are overwhelmed. 
This section will attempt to explain the most important sources.
We also offer a walkthrough:

{% assign page_links = '/pages/walkthrough/walkthrough, /pages/walkthrough/walkthrough2' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

Since this ARG is still ongoing, updates will be reflected in the walkthrough as soon as possible. <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>

### The Album

The album itself contains many tracks, with some of them hiding secrets! Nearly all tracks 
have a lyric video and there are many [official videos](https://www.bmthofficial.com/videos/) too.

There is also lore from [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](pages/music/ph-survival-horror) and [amo](pages/music/amo), 
but it's best to start with the new material first!

### The Webpage

The webpage for the ARG can be found [here](https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html) 
and provides the bulk of what we know about the Nex Gen lore. The wiki also covers [the webpage](pages/webpage) 
itself and the different software on it. The serial number on the side of M8's head on the album cover 
is the code you will need to get into the website.

Currently, many functionalities (including wi-fi) are disabled. Updates have mostly opened up 
files in a folder called [FOR SOF](pages/for-sof). The recommended order is to read about the webpage first, 
then read more about the files in this folder. All passwords are spoiler-tagged, but articles about characters, songs 
or the lore will obviously contain many spoilers.

### Socials & other sources

Currently the ARG is in active development and many exciting things 
are happening. BMTH also post ARG- and Nex Gen-related posts on their Instagram, 
Twitter/X, YouTube and Facebook. 
We include some of these posts in the various articles where relevant.

Some [other webpages](pages/other-webpages) have also been linked or are theorized to link to this ARG, 
they are discussed in their own article.
