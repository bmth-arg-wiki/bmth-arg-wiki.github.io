content="Welcome to the Bring Me The Horizon ARG Wiki! We are here to help you get started." 
%}


This wiki centers all around the mysteries around the album [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn](pages/music/ph-nex-gen). 
The Alternate Reality Game, or ARG, is currently still developing and so is [the team](pages/about). Our team will 
try to regularly update the website and improve the look and experience. This wiki will focus on objective 
information as much as possible and indicate whenever something is not confirmed.

***

## Newest Pages

The wiki has grown to over 100+ pages, growing regularly with updates from [our small team](pages/about). 
As of April 2025, these are the newest pages you might want to check out!

{% assign page_links = '/pages/website/emulator, /pages/website/emulator-escape, /pages/website/emulator-screamstar' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

## Overviews

The wiki contains many pages documenting the website (including older versions), files distributed digitally and 
in-person, characters and the ARG universe and the interesting concepts within. You can find all of our articles 
linked in these overview pages.

{% assign page_links = '/pages/website/website, /pages/for-sof/for-sof, /pages/characters/characters, /pages/lore/lore, /pages/music/music' | split: ", " %}

## Getting started

{% include content/info.html
title="Still updating..."
icon="fa-solid fa-info"
content="We are currently working on a new 'website' category, finishing up our character articles, and 
we've added lots of [lore](pages/lore/lore) to explore!"
%}

There is a lot going on in this ARG! We get it if you are overwhelmed. 
This section will attempt to explain the most important sources.

### The Album

The album itself contains many tracks, with some of them hiding secrets! Nearly all tracks 
have a lyric video and there are many [official videos](https://www.bmthofficial.com/videos/) too.

There is also lore from [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](pages/music/ph-survival-horror) and [amo](pages/music/amo), 
but it's best to start with the new material first!

### The Webpage

The [webpage](https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html) for the ARG can be found 
provides the bulk of what we know about the Nex Gen lore.
The wiki also covers [the webpage](pages/website/website) 
itself and the different software on it.
The serial number on the side of M8's head on the album cover 
is the code you will need to get into the website.

### Socials & other sources

Currently, the ARG is in active development and many exciting things 
are happening. BMTH also post ARG- and Nex Gen-related posts on their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bringmethehorizon), 
[Twitter](https://x.com/bmthofficial), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BMTHOfficialVEVO), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bmthofficial/) 
and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bmthofficial). We include some of these posts in the various articles where relevant.

Some [other webpages](pages/other-webpages) have also been linked or are theorized to link to this ARG, 
they are discussed in their own article. This includes the secret [genxsis.faith](https://genxsis.faith) cult website, 
the [Mantra](https://joinmantra.org) website and [dungeoncrawl33r](https://dungeoncrawl33r.com), which some barcodes 
on the posters point to.
