# Welcome to YOUtopia

> *"Where love is the law, a Youtopia"*

Welcome to this wiki about BMTH's NexGen ARG. This is a work in progress, since this is an ongoing 
ARG and new updates will be added regularly.
This wiki will focus on objective information as much as possible and indicate whenever something is not confirmed.

***

## Getting started

There is a lot going on in this ARG! We get it if you are overwhelmed. 
This section will attempt to explain the most important sources.

### The Album

The album itself contains many tracks, with some of them hiding secrets! Nearly all tracks 
have a lyric video and there are many [official videos](https://www.bmthofficial.com/videos/) too.

There is also lore from [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](pages/music/ph-survival-horror) and [amo](pages/music/amo), 
but it's best to start with the new material first!

### The Webpage

The webpage for the ARG can be found [here](https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html) 
and provides the bulk of what we know about the Nex Gen lore. The wiki also covers [the webpage](pages/webpage) 
itself and the different software on it. The serial number on the side of M8's head on the album cover 
is the code you will need to get into the website.

Currently, many functionalities (including wi-fi) are disabled. Updates have mostly opened up 
files in a folder called [FOR SOF](pages/files/for-sof). The recommended order is to read about the webpage first, 
then read more about the files in this folder. All passwords are spoiler-tagged, but articles about characters, songs 
or the lore will obviously contain many spoilers.

### Socials & other sources

Currently the ARG is in active development and many exciting things 
are happening. While this wiki was created for facts, we also have a [notion site](https://the-secret-tinfoil-society.notion.site/BRING-ME-THE-HORIZON-ARG-6c86ee58ee3b41a6b0c594cf59201d4b?pvs=4)
holding the theories and secrets of our secret tinfoil society.

BMTH also post ARG- and Nex Gen-related posts on their Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube and Facebook. Some important 
posts are covered on [the page on social posts](pages/socials/social-posts).

Some [other webpages](pages/other-webpages) have also been linked or are theorised to link to this ARG, 
they are discussed in their own article.
