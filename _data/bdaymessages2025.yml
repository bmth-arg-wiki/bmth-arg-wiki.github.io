      HAPPY BIRTHDAY your music saved my life and I'm absolutely in LOVE with all the NexGen lore :D when you came to Brisbane last year was the greatest moments of my entire life, it was so amazing to see one of the sleep token members play on stage with you! BMTH is seriously one of the best things to ever happen to me, so thank you so much for making me feel better when I'm sad :) HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY and I'm so happy for you and your wife and kids!!

      Happy Birthday, Oli! 🎉

      I just wanted to say thank you for everything. I’ve been going through some tough times lately, and your music and everything you’ve created with BMTH has truly helped me more than words can say. Running the BMTH France page has become my safe zone, a place that gives me strength and purpose when life feels heavy.

      I’ve had the chance to see BMTH live more than ten times, and I’m so proud of that. Every show feels special, and every time reminds me why I love this band so much. The energy, the emotion — it’s healing. Thank you for creating something so powerful for people like me.

      Your music and the way you are as a person inspire me to be a better version of myself every day. You’ve influenced millions of people around the world, and I know this is only the beginning.

      I wish you nothing but happiness for you and your beautiful family. I have no doubt you’re going to be the best dad in the world to your two kids — they’re so lucky to have you.

      I really hope to see you at a festival this year! I’ve already got my Hellfest tickets (it sold out before even announcing the lineup, haha), so fingers crossed you’ll be there!

      Thank you again for everything you’ve done and continue to do. I love you like a brother, truly ❤️‍🔥 And I know this is only the beginning for BMTH — I’ll keep supporting you until the very end.

      If BMTH has 100,000 supporters, I’m one of them.
      If BMTH has only one supporter, it’s me.
      If the whole world is against BMTH, then I’m against the world.
      And if BMTH has no supporters left, it means I’m gone.

      With all my love and respect,
      Mick – BMTH France 🇫🇷🖤

      Hey Oli! Just wanted to say how insanely inspiring you are like genuinely, you’ve changed the way I think about so many things. Because of you, I went vegetarian over a year ago and now I’m working towards a fully vegan lifestyle. You made me realize how much of an impact one person can have just by being authentic and passionate.

      Also… I actually met my partner through you and BMTH 🥹 so I owe you for that too, honestly. You’ve been such a big part of my growth not just musically, but mentally and emotionally. Thank you for existing, for being unapologetically you, and for continuing to inspire so many of us to be kinder, braver, and a little more chaotic in the best way.

      Happy birthday, legend 🖤

      Happy birthday scorpio mate! Wish you to be happy all the time, get joy from every day and remain the same beautiful person that you are. 
      Your music saved me so many times I can't even remember. Your songs were with me even in the hardest times started from 6th grade and continued now on the 3rd year of the university. You are a great person, the greatest song writer and I can't be more grateful for you. 
      I wish you to be surrounded by good people, I wish all your loved ones to be healthy and happy and wish your family all the best. 
      From Russia with love❤️

      Then, I wanted to thank you so much for all you always did for your fans, for all the moments you gave us the opportunity tu live, these moments that stay forever in our mind (personally you rocked my world for the first time in Koln Palladium this year, and also in Reading Festival in August, where I was front row and I got the chance to hug you during drown, that moment was by far one of the best in my life, thanks for that again, thanks for winning me over with this world which the metal world is, you helped me through so many difficult moments, and you and your band mean the fucking world to me, I love you so much.
      See you in MSG in NYC in May 2026 ❤️‍🔥

      Just to thank you for all the powerful messages your music has brought to so many people. I’ve been listening to all your albums since 2009, and every single one of them is incredible. In 2016, I had the chance to see you at the Rocher de Palmer (Bordeaux), and seeing where you are today is truly amazing! It’s so well deserved after all the hard work you’ve put in! Just like the Zénith in Toulouse in 2023 🥹 — those kinds of venues are so special because they allow us to feel so close to you!

      Wishing you a very happy birthday surrounded by your beautiful family and friends!!!

      P.S. If you ever do another live performance like the one at the Royal Albert Hall, it would be absolutely incredible!!! I still regret not being able to get that vinyl for my collection!

      Happy Birthday Oli! I hope you have the best of the days! Thanks for saving my life so many times and writing the music that gave me the strength to keep going every day when I didn’t want to wake up, fighting my depression is way easier with your music. You’re my greatest inspiration and I hope someday we see each other again like last year when I met you in Argentina! The way you empathized when I told you my story and the way you hugged me after I bursted into tears will forever be my favorite moment ever. You’re such a kind human being.
      Also congrats on being a father!! I wish you the best in this chapter of your life!!
      Sending you lots of love.  
      Tomi  
      Ps: I did get your signature tattooed!!
