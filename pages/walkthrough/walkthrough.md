## Quick navigation

- [Step 0: Listen to the album](#step-0-listen-to-the-album)
- [Step 1: The website](#step-1-the-website)
- [Step 2: The files](walkthrough2) (next page)

Since we are currently still unlocking the many files in the file folder, it is unknown when we will start a next step.

***

## Step 0: Listen to the album

You are probably here because you did this already! However, if you didn't, go listen 
to the **full** album first.
The [ost]'s also have relevance to the plot.

Additionally,
you can get a feel for the setting and lore by watching the music videos and checking out Bring Me The Horizon on 
YouTube, Instagram, X and Threads.

## Step 1: The Website

The first step is to gain access to the ARG website.

### Finding the website

The first step is to find the website.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

At the end of Dig It we hear a funny little robot and some weird sounds. There is 
definitely more hidden there!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

You're going to have to use some kind of tool to visualize audio, like Audacity.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

There is a hidden QR code in the spectrogram and it leads us to
https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html.
</details>

Now we will need to log in to the webpage.

### Gaining access

To gain access to the website we need to enter our first password.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

To find the code, we need the serial number of M8, the robot on the website.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take a closer look at the album cover of NEx Gen.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The serial number we are looking for is 93934521 and can be seen on the side of M8's head 
on the NEx Gen album cover.
</details>

We're in! Once you are logged into the website, you can click around to learn 
more about the different functionalities it has to offer.
You can also read more about them on this wiki.

Want more details? The related articles on the wiki will tell you more about what
you are seeing.

Continue to the next objective: [unlocking the files in the FOR SOF folder](walkthrough2).
