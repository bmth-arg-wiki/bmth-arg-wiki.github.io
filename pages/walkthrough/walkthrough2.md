## The folder

The folder can be found on the left side of the webpage. It's orange with an interesting
symbol on it.
When we click the folder, we find out that it's locked!

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

The password can be found by taking a good look at the ARG website itself.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take a good look at the system time; you'll notice that there is something off about it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The password for the folder is "past". We don't have an official explanation for this, but it is assumed
to be the password due to the time discrepancies on the webpage.
</details>

You can find more explanations about the webpage by reading some related articles.

contain hints in the form of symbols.

<details>

## CAPSLOCK.DOC

This file is a special case, as it was uncovered before it was supposed to be.
Also see the [article on this file](../files/capslock_doc).
We recommend reading this file at the end of your walkthrough and not following the instructions
in it.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

You are going to have a closer look at the album track list.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take the capital letters from the track list and find an anagram that matches
the phrase on the password screen.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

By decoding the capital letters from the track list, we get
'DEKODE THE MATRIX TO ATTAIN YOUR CONCEALED ORIGINS'.
</details>

Let's move on with the file actually intended to be next.

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

The password for this document was found on Instagram.
