## The folder

The folder can be found on the left side of the webpage. It's orange with an interesting
symbol on it.
When we click the folder, we find out that it's locked!

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

The password can be found by taking a good look at the ARG website itself.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take a good look at the system time; you'll notice that there is something off about it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The password for the folder is "past". We don't have an official explanation for this, but it is assumed
to be the password due to the time discrepancies on the webpage.
</details>

You can find more explanations about the webpage by reading some related articles.

## Insight files

Files 3–6 are a set of four, as is visible from their filenames. Their password screens
contain hints in the form of symbols.

<details>
<summary>Files hint 1</summary>

As you can gather from the file names, the passwords are related to the four insights
we just read about.
These were actually revealed in multiple social media posts, so take a look on Instagram or X.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Files hint 2</summary>

There is more hidden in the audio on NEx Gen. Have a look at the songs again!
</details>

Solutions:
<details>
<summary>Solution first file</summary>

The first insight is 'connection'.
The [spectrogram](../music/spectrograms) for [Top 10 staTues tHat CriEd bloOd](../music/song-top10)
contains this password, but we can also see it in several social media posts.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution second file</summary>

The second insight is 'empathy' and can be found in the [spectrogram](../music/spectrograms)
in [n/A](../music/song-na). It can also be seen in social media posts occasionally.

## CAPSLOCK.DOC

This file is a special case, as it was uncovered before it was supposed to be.
Also see the [article on this file](../files/capslock_doc).
We recommend reading this file at the end of your walkthrough and not following the instructions
in it.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

You are going to have a closer look at the album tracklist.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take the capital letters from the tracklist and find an anagram that matches
the phrase on the password screen.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

By decoding the capital letters from the tracklist, we get
'DEKODE THE MATRIX TO ATTAIN YOUR CONCEALED ORIGINS'.
</details>

Let's move on with the file actually intended to be next.

## Sky_&_The_Starjammers.png


<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

The password for this document was found on Instagram.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Find the Instagram post where there is a photo of Oli and an older Nex Gen document. 
Zoom in on the document and you will find numbers you can match up to letters.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

This requires the Instagram post where a Nex Gen doc is shown on a picture of Oli.
It is not on the first slide.
By zooming in on the doc we can see numbers, which correspond to letters in the words that 
are circled.
By switching them around we can form the password: 'INTERCELLULAR'
