> "I'm not looking salvation, just a little faith in anyone or anything."

"In The Dark" is a song from the album 'Amo'. Its music video contains many references to a mysterious 
organization called ARC/HIVE, just like [the D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log).

The video also showcases the altilium chordata tanks mentioned in [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) as well as [Dr. Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) re-experiencing what we think might be the mares also mentioned in [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust)

Moreover, we see a woman who seems to be [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca).

## Lyrics

<details class="lyrics">
    <summary>Lyrics</summary>

Oh, I’ve done it again/
Dug a little deep and it’s all caved in/
Now I free fall in a black hole/ 
I know I’m getting warm cos I feel so cold./
But I’m looking on the bright side now/ 
Trying to figure out somehow (none of this is real but)/ 
It’s looking like a write off now/
I think we need to talk like now./

So don’t swear to god he never asked you/
It’s not his heart you drove a knife through/
not his world you turned inside out/ 
not his tears still rolling down/ 
Jesus Christ you’re so damn cold/
Don’t you know you’ve lost control?/ 
Forget about the things you think I know/ 
No secrets, you can’t keep me in the dark/ 

Deathblow, look at you go/
Brought a T-62 to a rodeo/
So tall it broke the fourth wall/ 
Guess my fairy-tale has a few plot holes/ 
well I’m looking on the bright side now/ 
Trying to figure out somehow (none of this is real no)/ 
you can give the act up now/ 
yeah, go ahead and take a bow./ 

I’m not looking for salvation, just a little faith In anyone or anything./
Cos it’s all come caving in/ 
And it’s time I knew you so
