> Sinking under
> Think my angels fallen
> Safe place, plundered
> Bastards kicked the doors in
> I picked the stitches
> Now I can’t stop bleeding
> Three in the morning I ain’t slept all weekend
> Six feet in the dirt, still breathing
> Don’t give a fuck if my heart stops beating
>
> Hey, I’m begging you to stay
> My darkside won today
> My heart keeps breaking
> Over and over
> Hey, don’t let me out your sight
> Can’t trust myself tonight
> My heart keeps breaking
> Can you talk me off the ledge again?
>
> Something haunts me
> Footsteps in the basement
> Out of body
> But there’s no escaping
> I picked the stitches
> Now I can’t stop bleeding
> Three in the morning, I ain’t slept all weekend
> Six feet in the dirt, still breathing
> Don’t give a fuck if my heart stops beating
>
> Hey, I’m begging you to stay
> My darkside won today
> My heart keeps breaking over and over
> Hey, don’t let me out your sight
> Can’t trust myself tonight
> My heart keeps breaking, can you talk me off the ledge again?
>
> Somethings in the way
> Don’t know what I can say
> Memories are haunting me
> A sickness taking over
> So bury me alive
> There’s nowhere left to hide
> And say goodbye
> Cos maybe I
> Maybe I will miss me when I’m gone
>
> Hey, I’m begging you to stay
> My darkside won today
> My heart keeps breaking over and over
> Hey, don’t let me out your sight
> Can’t trust myself tonight
> My heart keeps breaking, can you talk me off the ledge again?
>
> Can’t trust myself tonight
> Can’t trust myself tonight
> Can’t trust myself
> Can you talk me off the ledge again?
