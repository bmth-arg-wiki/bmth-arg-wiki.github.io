## Lyrics

<summary>Expand lyrics</summary>

> Maybe I’ll just be fucked up forever
> should have figured myself out by now
> And I don’t wanna tear myself open, no
> But it’s hard to care when you bleed out
>
> So won’t you break me down, break me down
> Make me get better
> I confess I’m a mess
> Some kind of error
> Well maybe I was destined to disappear
>
> We’re just a room full of strangers
> Looking for something to save us
> Alone together
> We’re dying to live and we’re living to die
> Dying to live, living to die
> We’re just a room full of strangers
>
> Well I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
> ‘Cause we’re walking on razors again
> And we swore to God we’d never let this happen, no
> We dragged ourselves through hell
> And we’ll be damned if we go back
>
> Break me down
> Break me down
> Make me get better I confess that I’m a mess
> Some kind of error
> Well maybe I was destined to disappear
>
> We’re just a room full of strangers
> Looking for something to save us
> Alone together,
> We’re dying to live
> And we’re living to die
> Dying to live, living to die It never stops
>
> Can’t erase this
> So cross out my eyes
> Tear the pages ‘Cause you and I
> We’re just dying to live And we’re living to die
> Dying to live, living to die It never stops, it don’t
>
> Where did we go?
> We’re all alone, all alone
> No place like home
> Take us back to yesterday
>
> S.O.S
> Save us from ourselves

The song was first announced as just `strangers`, without 
the capitalization. Alternate capitalization `StRaNgErs` was 
found in a post on Oli's instagram, with what seems to be 
a version of the lyrics with minor adjustments.
