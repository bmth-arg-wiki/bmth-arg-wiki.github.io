> you know that i’d die for
> i cry for
> you know that i’d die for you
> you know that i breathe for
> i bleed for
> you know that i breathe for you
> let me see my halo
> even though it’s painful
> i’m prepared to lose
> you know that i’d die for
> i cry for
> you know that i’d die for you
> i keep holding my breath for a miracle
> hoping the hole in my heart would have healed somehow
> feeling so fucking close to the edge right now
> you know you’re everything i hate
> wish i could escape
> but you know i would die for you
> cos i’ve died inside
> a thousand times
> but still i kill myself for you
> because the truth of it
> you could slit my wrists
> & i’d write your name in a heart with the haemorrhage
> feeling so fucking close to the edge right now
> i know it’s you i need to kick
> you make me feel like shit
> and i don’t want to die for you
> this isn’t love
> this is a car crash
> this isn’t love
> this is a blood bath
> this isn’t love
> this is a sentence
> it’s a bullet in the head
> so pull the trigger
