> “Parasite Eve,” the second single from POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR, was recorded during 
the 2020’s quarantine and, although the inspiration for the track didn’t come from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, there are a lot of references to it. The title comes from a 1998 
survival horror game of the same name released by Square. The band said:
>
> We’ve got to look that face to face. We’ve got to confront it. We’ve got to feel it. 
We’ve got to breathe it. We’ve got to live it sometimes to get through this. You know, 
it’s understandable that we want to repress these feelings, and sometimes becoming 
civilised requires us to repress aspects of ourselves that don’t fit in with the 
structured ideal of our society.
>
> During the promotion of the song, the band changed their helix logo for a broken 
version.
>
> The song was expected to be released on 2020, June, 10th, but was postponed due 
to the George Floyd protests and all Black Lives Matter protests around the world. 
As Oliver Sykes stated:
>
> So as some of you know we were planning on releasing a new track this week. 
But with the incredible movement that is taking place currently we don’t feel 
comfortable releasing and promoting anything that takes the focus off what’s important 
right now. I know you will all understand because we have the best fans in the world and 
I promise you we won’t make you wait too long and the good news is more music will be 
coming soon after “Parasite Eve” too. But for now keep fighting the good fight and stay tuned.
>
> The game tells the story of a cop named Aya who is fighting against a biological entity that 
calls itself Eve, who formed when a mitochondrial cell mutated and evolved, eventually 
becoming self-aware and seeking a host beyond humanity.
>
> Eve threatens all life on Earth by causing her victims to spontaneously combust. The entity 
seeks to replace humanity with superior organisms that have control over their own DNA, 
and considers humanity to be a parasite leeching off the planet.
>
> Also, when asked about what would he like to achieve on his last day alive, Oli Sykes said:
A speed run on Parasite Eve’s hardest setting.
>
> Musically, it was influenced a lot by Oli Sykes playing a game called DOOM Eternal, as well as 
the contributions of the game soundtrack artist Mick Gordon, giving it a futuristic and cyber 
overlay.

> “‘Parasite Eve’ was about the dawn of a new problem that mankind was going to face,” 
says Sykes. “I was getting anxious, feeling that this could be our future. I wrote it 
before Covid, and we talked a lot about whether or not we should release it. We were 
worried if it was offensive. The line, ‘When we forget the infection / Will we remember 
the lesson?’ was originally ‘If we survive the infection…’. That line just shook me at 
first because people were actually dying.
> 
> “Then we thought, ‘People need this, actually’, to get a cathartic experience from music 
and process things a little bit – even if it is dark. That really cemented what we wanted 
to do with this record and what the rest of the album was going to be themed around.”
