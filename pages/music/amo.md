## Relevance & links

The song Mantra was long suspected to be related to the 
ARG and a link was made between the [D8 log](../files/lauren_d8_log) and the ARC/HIVE company 
we see in "In the Dark". The [Trinity analysis document](../files/trinity_document) first
introduced on 19-06-2024 confirmed this.

Another link made directly because of this document is [Mantra](amo-mantra).
The files [Nex Gen leak 'UNBELEEVABLE'](../files/unbeleevable) and [Sky_&_the_Starjammers.png](../files/skystarjammers) 
also mention characters we see in this music video.

Additionally, we get expansions on the lore in some other files mentioned under [Read More](#read-more)

[Sugar, Honey, Ice & Tea](amo-shit) has strong ties to Mantra (showing the Mantra suit and some 
articles about cults), containing imagery about angels and more.

[Nihilist Blues](amo-nihilist-blues), while only getting a lyric video release, 
seems to contain some cryptic messages that might relate to the ARG lore as well.
