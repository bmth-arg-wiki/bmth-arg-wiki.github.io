# amo

amo (2019) is an album about love. The album came out before [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](ph-survival-horror), 
but has been linked back to the ARG for [Nex Gen](ph-nex-gen) too.

## Tracklist

{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

[Mantra](amo-mantra) directly ties back to the [Neosages/Mantra cult](../lore/mantra). [Nihilist Blues](amo-nihilist-blues),
while only getting a lyric video release, seems to contain some cryptic messages that might relate to the ARG lore as
well. [In The Dark](amo-in-the-dark) is the first music video Oli ever directed and has significant ties to the lore,
introducing an organisation called [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive). [Sugar, Honey, Ice & Tea](amo-shit) has strong ties to
Mantra (showing the Mantra suit and some articles about cults), containing imagery about angels and more. 
Connections to other songs have not (yet) been found.

## Relevance & links

### Lore significance

The song Mantra was long suspected to be related to the
ARG and a link was made between the [D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log) and the ARC/HIVE company
we see in "in the dark". The [Trinity analysis document](../for-sof/trinity_document) first
introduced on 19-06-2024 confirmed this.

The [D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log) introduces us to [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) and [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren).
[Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) goes deeper into the research at this organisation from 2021. Another
project ARC/HIVE seemed to have some involvement in is the production of synths, as we see in the
[Tekka Interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview).

[The Science Study](../for-sof/thesciencestudy) introduces a rare phenomenon causing people to be born with pink hair.
This relates back to the mysterious leader of the [MANTRA/Neosages](../lore/mantra) cult, [Skys](../characters/skys).
The cult resides in a location called October Palace, which we can also see in [Sky_&_the_Starjammers.png](../for-sof/skystarjammers).
We learn more about the Mantra cult from Dr Lee in the [Nex Gen leak 'UNBELEEVABLE'](../for-sof/unbeleevable).

Skys and Dallus are members of the [Trinity](../characters/characters#trinity), as we learn in
[Trinity Analysis Document](../for-sof/trinity_document).
