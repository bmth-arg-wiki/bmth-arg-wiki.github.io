# Amo

Amo (2019) is an album about love. The song Mantra was long suspected to be related to the 
ARG and a link was made between the [D8 log](../files/lauren_d8_log) and the ARC/HIVE company 
we see in "In the Dark". Both links were confirmed by the [Trinity analysis document](../files/trinity_document) first 
introduced on 19-06-2024.
