> there’s a place i wanna take you
> but i’m not quite there myself yet
> i’m getting better but there’s still days
> where i wish that i was someone else
>
> but i know
> there is a home
> somewhere
> beyond my bones
> and i’m just too terrified
> to dive inside 
>
> soul like a cemetery
> hard to ignore
> we’re sick to the core
> a world’s been buried
> where love is the law
> a youtopia
> (scream) 
>
> golden raspberry
> for the performance in your head
> stop pushing daisies
> no one wants flowers
> when they’re dead 
>
> soul like a cemetery
> hard to ignore
> we’re sick to the core
> a world’s been buried
> where love is the law
> a youtopia
>
> there is a home
> beyond our bones
> so connect
> to the divine
> it’s ok to cry
> yeah
> soul like a cemetery
> hard to ignore
> we’re sick to the core
> a world’s been buried
> where love is the law
> a youtopia
> there's a place i wanna take you
> a youtopia
> there's a place i wanna take you
> a youtopia
> there's a place i wanna take you
> where love is the law
