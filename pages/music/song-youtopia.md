```
there’s a place i wanna take you 
but i’m not quite there myself yet 
i’m getting better but there’s still days 
where i wish that i was someone else
 
but i know 
there is a home 
somewhere
beyond my bones
and i’m just too terrified 
to dive inside 
 
soul like a cemetery 
hard to ignore 
we’re sick to the core 
a world’s been buried 
where love is the law
a youtopia
(scream) 
 
golden raspberry 
for the performance in your head 
stop pushing daisies 
no one wants flowers 
when they’re dead 
 
soul like a cemetery 
hard to ignore 
we’re sick to the core 
a world’s been buried 
where love is the law
a youtopia
 
there is a home
beyond our bones 
so connect 
to the divine
it’s ok to cry 
yeah 
soul like a cemetery 
hard to ignore 
we’re sick to the core 
a world’s been buried 
where love is the law
a youtopia
there's a place i wanna take you 
a youtopia
there's a place i wanna take you 
a youtopia
there's a place i wanna take you 
where love is the law
a youtopia
```
