# YOUtopia (song)


{% include content/info.html
title="YOUtopia (Song)"
content="This article is about the song, not the [dimension](../lore/youtopia)."
%}

YOUtopia is the second song of the album. It shares a name with the fictional universe of [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia), 
even though the stylisation is different.

The song serves as an introduction to the concept of [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia), a beautiful dimension "where 
love is the law".
