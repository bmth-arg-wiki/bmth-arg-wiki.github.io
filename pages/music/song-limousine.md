> drag me down some more
> get me low like a basement
> i hope that you wrote
> all your songs for me
>
> on my last nerve
> burnt out all my veins
> blue angels trying to sacrifice the shame
> soul crushing going back around the turn again
> cut my teeth on a diamond till it’s rough
> feeling good but it’s never good enough
> got a bellyache crawling in my guts again
>
> come closer
> i’ll swallow the bile for you
> don’t want closure
> i’ll stitch myself up alone
> drag me down some more
> get me low like a basement
> i hope that you wrote
> all your songs for me
> kiss the ground i walk
> i’m a fool for you
> in a rut
> belted up
> in the limousine
>
> hop inside
> take a ride to the top
> we can brake
> but we’re never gonna stop
> got a death wish tugging on my sleeves again
>
> roll over
> i’ll tickle that spot for you
> it’s not over
> didn’t want to let go
>
> drag me down some more
> get me low like a basement
> i hope that you wrote
> all your songs for me
> kiss the ground i walk
> i’m a fool for you
> in a rut
> belted up
> in the limousine
> so lock all the doors
> cos i’m insecure
> let’s get out of here
> what the fuck you waiting for? 
>
> do you like the way your skin crawls?
> how it makes your body twitch?
>
> does it make you sick?
> does it make you sick?
> does it make you sick?
> sick.
