## Lyrics

<details class="lyrics">
    <summary>Lyrics</summary>

Another day another post-traumatic order/
(Brainwashed and feeling fine)/
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer/
So I stabbed a fork in my eye/
think I’m losing my fucking mind/
Don’t know where to turn, now I’m blind/
Destroy yourself it feels so good to fade away/
Why, d’you want to hurt yourself?/
Die, for something else?/
Don’t let your conscience get in the way/

Obey/
We hope you have a lovely day/
Obey/
You don’t want us to come out and play/
Away, now now/
There’s nothing to see here/
It’s under control/
We’re only gambling with your soul/
Obey/
Whatever you do, just don’t wake up and smell the corruption/

Another day another systematic nightmare/
Commemorate a wonderful life/
Bite me first I’ll bite you back/
Melodramatic laughter/
I stabbed a knife in my eye/
Think I’m out my fucking mind/
Brainwashed and I’m feeling fine/ 
Destroy yourself it feels too good to fade away/
Why, do I want to hurt myself?/
Should I die for something else?/
I let my conscience get in the way/

Obey/
We hope you have a lovely day/
Obey/
You don’t want us to come out and play/
Away, now now/
There’s nothing to see here/
It’s under control/
We’re only gambling with your soul/
Obey/
Whatever you do, just don’t wake up and smell the corruption/

When your freedom is lethal/
Tell me how you’re going to hurt yourself/
You call yourselves peaceful/
you monsters are people/

you fucking monsters are people/
Obey/
We’re gonna show you how to behave/
Obey/
It’s nicer when you can’t see the chains.

## Interviews

> Pop-metal banger ‘Obey’ sees the band implore the listener to “wake up and smell the
> corruption”. “Lyrically, it’s very much coming from the oppressor saying, ‘Don’t pay
> too much attention! Get on with your lives and you won’t have too much trouble',” he
> explains. “‘If you do kick up a fuss, we’re going to come out and put you right.’
> It echoes what Donald Trump said throughout the BLM protests, seeming to support
> right-wing groups. It’s the stuff of nightmares. It’s trying to convey that notion
> that we are being a bit too submissive.”
