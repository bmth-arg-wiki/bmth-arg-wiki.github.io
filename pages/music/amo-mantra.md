# MANTRA (song)

{% include content/info.html
title="Mantra (Song)"
content="This article is about the song MANTRA, not about [the cult](../lore/mantra)."
%}

> "Do you want to start a cult with me?"

"Mantra" is the second song from the album "amo".
It is related to the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra), which 
we can learn more about in a few different files:

- [Trinity document](../for-sof/trinity_document)
- [Unbeleevable video](../for-sof/unbeleevable)
- [Skys & the Starjammers poster](../for-sof/skystarjammers)

There was also a website with a teaser called `joinmantra.org`. It is no longer 
available on the internet, but you can learn more about it in the [cult article](../lore/mantra).

{{"
Do you wanna start a cult with me?/
I’m not vibrating like I oughta be/
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing/
Through this existential misery/
Now, we are going to need some real estate/
But if I choose my words carefully/
Think I could fool you that I’m the guru/
Wait, how do you spell epiphany?/

Before the truth will set you free/
It’ll piss you off/
Before you find a place to be/
You’re gonna lose the plot/
Too late to tell you now/
One ear and right out the other one/
Because all you ever do is chant the same old mantra/

Could I have your attention please/
It’s time to tap in to your tragedy/
Think you could use a new abuser/
Close your eyes and listen carefully/
Imagine you're stood on a beach/
Water gently lapping at your feet/
But now your sinking/
What were you thinking?/
That’s all the time we have this week/

And I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense/
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?/
All I’m asking for’s a little bit of faith/
You know it's easy to believe/
And I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense./ 
Y’know you gotta work the corners of your mind now/
All I’m asking for’s a little bit of faith/
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe
