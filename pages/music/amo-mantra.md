# MANTRA

Second song from the album "Amo". It is related to the Mantra cult, which 
we can learn more about in a few different files:

- [Trinity document](../files/trinity_document)
- [Unbeleevable video](../files/unbeleevable)
- [Skys & the Starjammers poster](../files/skystarjammers)

There was also a website with a teaser called `joinmantra.org`.
