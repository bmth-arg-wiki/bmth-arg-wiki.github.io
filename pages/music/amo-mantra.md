# MANTRA

Second song from the album "Amo". It is related to the Mantra cult, which 
we can learn more about in a few different files:

- [Trinity document](../files/trinity_document)
- [Unbeleevable video](../files/unbeleevable)
- [Skys & the Starjammers poster](../files/skystarjammers)

There was also a website with a teaser called `joinmantra.org`.

*An invitation to salvation* is shown on the webpage, along with the Mantra logo. 
The website contained a slightly moving image of Oli in the music video.
It was revealed to be a teaser for the song.

The website sadly does not exist in this form,
but it can be viewed on the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190408225654/http://www.joinmantra.org/).
