### R.i.p. (duskCOre Remix)

Contains an image of a skull, with characters above and below that have not been identified. This song also 
contains a small audio fragment from the game Undertale, specifically to a skeleton named Sans. The skull is likely a 
reference and might not be a clue to the ARG itself.
