"Itch For The Cure" and "Kingslayer" are the fifth and sixth songs on the album [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](ph-survival-horror).

The concept of "Kingslayer" plays a large role in the ARG, as can be seen in some filenames in the [FOR SOF](../files/for-sof) folder
(eg. [Kingsl@yer_EncrypMsg.codek](../files/kingslayercodec.md)).

## Lyrics

### Itch For The Cure

<details class="lyrics">
    <summary>Lyrics</summary>

I know why you're here, you're fed up of the fear/
Sick of the fantasy world they've built, so you never see clear/
Something is coming unplugged (Coming unplugged)/
There's a glitch in your trust/
You got an itch for the cure, but you're scared to walk out the door/
I'm here to tell you there's a universe that lives without law/
Something is coming unplugged (Unplugged)/
'Cause you keep asking yourself/

When will we be free?/

I wanna be a kingslayer (When will we be free?)/
Something is coming unplugged (When will we be free?)/
There's a glitch in your trust.

### Kingslayer

<details class="lyrics">
    <summary>Lyrics</summary>

hi, are you looking for the other side?/
feel like nothing ever seems quite right?/
are you circling the drain pipe,/
getting off on pain like/
you’re corrupted?/
i need to know where your loyalties lie/
tell me are you gonna bark or bite?/ 
do you really want to twist the knife/
in the belly of the monster?/
get the fuck up/ 
wake the fuck up/
wipe the system 
and back the fuck up./ 
you’re a puppet/
when they cut your strings off/
don’t come crawling back./
(you're on your own)/

kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky/
kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye/
i’d sacrifice my life to find you/
angel of the blade/
kingslayer, come and collect us from the night/

暗い (Cry)/ 
 この見えない世界/
 まだ消えない未来/
 ただ手に入れたい/
another world/

system failure/ 
life is encrypted/ 
you are modified/
like a virus in a lullaby/ 
artificial ‘til the day you die silly programme/
you’re corrupted!/
 
さあ 時の/
扉を開けて/
行こうよ/

kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky/
kingslayer, i’ll fight for you until i die/
kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky/
kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye/
i’d sacrifice it all to guide you/
never have to battle alone/
kingslayer, come and collect us from the night/

this is your wake up call/
we’re going down the rabbit hole/
are you ready?/
i can’t feel you./
is this what you want?/
this is what you’ll fucking get./

## Genius Annotation

> An interlude between the two halfs of the record, 
“Itch for the Cure (When Will We Be Free?)” is a direct 
reference to Linkin Park’s “Cure for the Itch.” The song’s 
outro comes from the album’s next song, “Kingslayer.” 
The band confirmed this on Twitter.

## Interviews

> The hook-laden ‘Kingslayer’, which features Japanese pop-metal sensations BABYMETAL, 
is an ode to someone who’s “willing to do what’s right even if it’s illegal,” says Sykes.
>
> Of BABYMETAL – not exactly a band for metal purists – Sykes says: “We wanted to do 
something with them for ages. We’ve got a really special connection with them, even 
though we don’t speak the same language. We don’t hang out or have conversations, but 
when you see them, it makes you really happy. They work so well with the whole idea of 
this record being cyber-punk-y. It sounds like an anime TV trailer.”
