# Itch For the Cure (When Will We Be Free) & Kingslayer

Itch for the Cure and Kingslayer are the 5th and 6th songs on [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](ph-survival-horror). 

The concept of a Kingslayer seems to play a large role in the ARG, which can 
for example be seen in the filenames in the [FOR SOF](../files/for-sof) folder.


> An interlude between the two halfs of the record, 
“Itch for the Cure (When Will We Be Free?)” is a direct 
reference to Linkin Park’s “Cure for the Itch.” The song’s 
outro comes from the album’s next song, “Kingslayer.” 
The band confirmed this on Twitter.

## Interviews

> The hook-laden ‘Kingslayer’, which features Japanese pop-metal sensations BABYMETAL, 
is an ode to someone who’s “willing to do what’s right even if it’s illegal”, says Sykes.
>
> Of BABYMETAL – not exactly a band for metal purists – Sykes says: “We wanted to do 
something with them for ages. We’ve got a really special connection with them, even 
though we don’t speak the same language. We don’t hang out or have conversations, but 
when you see them, it makes you really happy. They work so well with the whole idea of 
this record being cyber-punk-y. It sounds like an anime TV trailer.”

> [Verse: Oliver Sykes]
> I know why you're here, you're fed up of the fear
> Sick of the fantasy world they've built, so you never see clear
> Something is coming unplugged (Coming unplugged)
> There's a glitch in your trust
> You got an itch for the cure, but you're scared to walk out the door
> I'm here to tell you there's a universe that lives without law
> Something is coming unplugged (Unplugged)
> 'Cause you keep asking yourself
>
> [Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
> When will we be free?
> When will we be free?
> Whеn will we be free?
> When will wе be free?
>
> [Outro: Oliver Sykes & Su-Metal]
> I wanna be a kingslayer (When will we be free?)
> Something is coming unplugged (When will we be free?)
> There's a glitch in your trust
> I wanna be a kingslayer (When will we be free?)
> Something is coming unplugged (When will we be free?)
> There's a glitch in your trust
