> watching evangelion
> with a big fat slug of ketamine
> i lost the plot a little while ago, oh-oh
> my dog just died
> my friends hate me
> i saw myself on mtv
> and my ego is not my amigo
>
> oh, maybe i don't belong on this planet
> red crescent moons all over my hands
> it's too much to take
> i can't understand it
>
> someone, tell me
> why am i this way?
> stupid medicine not doing anything
> what the hell is fucking wrong with me?
> i guess there's no remedy
> i'm so terribly lost
>
> imaginary enemies
> suicidal tendencies
> serotonin's proper on its arse, oh-oh
> i used to go to therapy
> but the doctor tried to section me
> the next time that i open up
> to someone will be my autopsy 
>
> because i don't think i belong on this planet
> red crescent moons all over my hands
> it's too much to take,
> i can't fucking stand it
>
> someone, tell me
> why am i this way?
> stupid medicine not doing anything
> what the hell is fucking wrong with me?
> i guess there's no remedy
> own worst enemy
> i'm so terribly lost
>
> if i keep this up
> i think i'm gonna break down
> if i keep this up
> i think i'm gonna break down
> i think i'm gonna break down
> i think i'm gonna break down
