Dear diary, I don't know what's going on, but something's up/
The dog won't stop barking and I think my TV is bust/
Every channel is the same, it's sending me insane/
And earlier, somebody bit me, what a fucking day/

The sky is falling, it's fucking boring/
I'm going braindead, isolated/
God is a shithead and we're his rejects/
Traumatised for breakfast/
I can't stomach anymore/
Survival Horror/

Dear diary, I feel itchy like there's bugs under my skin/
The dog's gone rabid (Shut the fuck up!) doing my head in/
I keep fading in and out, I don't know where I've been/
I feel so hungry, what the hell is happening?/

The sky is falling, it's fucking boring/
I'm going braindead, isolatеd/
God is a shithead and we're his rеjects/
Traumatised for breakfast/
I can't stomach anymore/
Survival Horror/

Dear diary, dog stopped barking, probably 'cause I ate his face/
'Tasty, itchy,' TV say there's no more human race/
Kinda sad my whole entire existence been a waste/
Ah, never mind, it's not the end of the world, oh, wait/

Fly, hahahaha, oh/
Lie, oh.

## Genius Annotation

> The album POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR makes references to several video games. In “Dear Diary,” 
there are multiple allusions to the original Resident Evil. Most specifically, the song alludes 
to a diary entry found in the Spencer mansion known as the “Keeper’s Diary.” The book is notable 
for its intimate description of a T-Virus infection written by a researcher undergoing the process. 
As the author succumbs to the infection, the last entry infamously reads: “Itchy. Tasty.”
