# Dear Diary,

First song on [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](ph-survival-horror). 
A lot of the [lyrics](#lyrics) on this song are referred to in 
[Scott's Diary](../files/scott_personal_journal).

Genius Annotations:

> The album POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR makes references to several video games. In “Dear Diary,” 
there are multiple allusions to the original Resident Evil. Most specifically, the song alludes 
to a diary entry found in the Spencer mansion known as the “Keeper’s Diary.” The book is notable 
for its intimate description of a T-Virus infection written by a researcher undergoing the process. 
As the author succumbs to the infection, the last entry infamously reads: “Itchy. Tasty.”

> Dear diary, I don't know what's going on, but something's up
> The dog won't stop barking and I think my TV is bust
> Every channel is the same, it's sending me insane
> And earlier, somebody bit me, what a fucking day
>
> [Chorus]
> The sky is falling, it's fucking boring
> I'm going braindead, isolated
> God is a shithead and we're his rejects
> Traumatised for breakfast
> I can't stomach anymore
> Survival Horror

> [Guitar Solo]

> [Verse 2]
> Dear diary, I feel itchy like there's bugs under my skin
The dog's gone rabid (Shut the fuck up!) doing my head in
I keep fading in and out, I don't know where I've been
I feel so hungry, what the hell is happening?
>
> [Chorus]
> The sky is falling, it's fucking boring
> I'm going braindead, isolatеd
> God is a shithead and we're his rеjects
> Traumatised for breakfast
> I can't stomach anymore
> Survival Horror

> [Bridge]
> Dear diary, dog stopped barking, probably 'cause I ate his face
> "Tasty, itchy," TV say there's no more human race
> Kinda sad my whole entire existence been a waste
> Ah, never mind, it's not the end of the world, oh, wait
>
> [Outro]
> Fly, hahahaha, oh
> Lie, oh
