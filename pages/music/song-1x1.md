## Interviews

> ‘1X1’, meanwhile, features British nu-metal revivalists Nova Twins, one of Sykes’ 
favourite new bands, who soundtracked many of his lockdown hours. Here the frontman 
laments that he’s been “reliving my memories – and they’re killing me one by one”. 
The song, he says, addresses “the guilt that we as a society carry for what we’ve done 
to other species and ethnicities and other genders”, but also the struggle to escape 
his own history.

<summary>Source: Genius.com</summary>

> [Intro: Oli Sykes]
> Put me outta my misery
>
> [Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
> Disconnected from the world again
> And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been
> So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
> Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit
>
> [Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
> So I ask myself, when will I learn?
> I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn
> I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired
>
> [Chorus: Oli Sykes]
> Put me outta my misery, my mind
> Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
> I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
> Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
>
> [Verse 2: Amy Love]
> Sabotaged myself again
> Got a brain like a hurricane
> Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends
> And I don't even care, no
> Got me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)
> Evil twin under the staircase (Oh my God)
> Think I'm looking at a long night
> I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
>
> [Pre-Chorus: Amy Love, Oli Sykes, Amy Love & Oli Sykes]
> Terrified (Terrified), I'm numb (But I'm numb)
> Annihilation never looked so good, shut up
> Hush your mouth, you talk too much
>
> [Chorus: Oli Sykes]
> Put me outta my misery, my mind
> Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
> I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
> Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
>
> [Bridge: Oli Sykes]
> And I'm staring into the void again
> No one knows what a mess I'm in
> The voices in my head say I'm just being paranoid
> But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself
> I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath
>
> [Chorus: Oli Sykes]
> Put me outta my misery, my mind
> Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
> I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
> Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
>
> [Outro: Oli Sykes]
> Yeah, it's killing me one by one
> And they're killing me one by one
