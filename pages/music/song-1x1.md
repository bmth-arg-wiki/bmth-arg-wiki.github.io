## Lyrics

<details class="lyrics">
<summary>Lyrics</summary>

disconnected from the world again./
no, the sun don’t shine in the place i’ve been./
so why you keep acting like i don’t exist?/
yeah, i feel like i’m ready to die but i can’t commit./ 

so i ask myself,/ 
when will i learn?/
i’d set myself on fire to feel the burn./ 
i’m scared that i’m never going to be repaired./

put me out of my misery,/
my mind feels like an archenemy/
can’t look me in the eyes/
i don’t know what hurts the most/
holding on or letting go/
reliving my memories/
and they’re killing me one by one./

sabotaged myself again/
got a brain like a hurricane/
me and that bitch no we can’t be friends/
and i don’t even care no./
got me sinking to a dark place/
outta love/
evil twin under the staircase/
oh my god/
think i’m looking at a long night/
i’m alone/
but i’m numb/ 
annihilation never looked so good./
shut up!/
hush your mouth you talk too much./

put me out of my misery,/
my mind feels like an archenemy/
can’t look me in the eyes/
i don’t know what hurts the most/
holding on or letting go/
reliving my memories/
and they’re killing me one by one./

and i’m staring into the void again/
no one knows what a mess i’m in/
the voices in my head say i’m just being paranoid/
but it’s bad for my health/
how much i hate myself/
i suffocate,/
the weight,/
it pulls me underneath.

## Interviews

> ‘1X1’, meanwhile, features British nu-metal revivalists Nova Twins, one of Sykes’ 
favourite new bands, who soundtracked many of his lockdown hours. Here the frontman 
laments that he’s been “reliving my memories – and they’re killing me one by one”. 
The song, he says, addresses “the guilt that we as a society carry for what we’ve done 
to other species and ethnicities and other genders”, but also the struggle to escape 
his own history.
