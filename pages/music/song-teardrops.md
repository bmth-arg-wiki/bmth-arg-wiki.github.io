    <summary>Lyrics</summary>

teardrops/

we hurt ourselves for fun/
force feed our fear until our hearts go numb/
addicted to a lonely kind of love./

what i wanna know../
is how we got this stressed out,/
paranoid/
everything is going dark/
nothing makes me sadder than my head./

i’m running out of teardrops/
let it hurt ‘til it stops/
i can’t keep my grip/
i’m slipping away from me/
oh god, everything is so fucked/
but i can’t feel a thing/
the emptiness is heavier than you think./

i’m tripping on the edge/
high as a kite, i’m never coming down./
and if you hear me/
guess you know how it feels/
to be alone/
so how’d we get this stressed out?/
paranoid/
everything is going dark/
nothing makes me sadder than my head./

suicidal, violent tragic state of mind./
lost my halo, now i’m my own anti-christ.

## Interviews

> “‘Teardrops’ is about how we’ve been traumatised into submission,” says Sykes. 
“Whether the media intended it to be that way or not, death just becomes statistics. 
We’ve been pummelled so much by bad news over the last year.” Speaking about the shocking 
death of George Floyd under the knee of a US police officer, which led to renewed momentum 
around the global Black Lives Matter protests, Sykes notes: “That was like, ‘Fucking hell, 
there’s some real bad shit going on that we’ve just been sleepwalking through.’”
