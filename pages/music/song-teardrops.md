## Interviews

> “‘Teardrops’ is about how we’ve been traumatised into submission,” says Sykes. 
“Whether the media intended it to be that way or not, death just becomes statistics. 
We’ve been pummelled so much by bad news over the last year.” Speaking about the shocking 
death of George Floyd under the knee of a US police officer, which led to renewed momentum 
around the global Black Lives Matter protests, Sykes notes: “That was like, ‘Fucking hell, 
there’s some real bad shit going on that we’ve just been sleepwalking through’.”

> [Intro: Oliver Sykes]
> Teardrops
>
> [Verse 1: Oliver Sykes]
> We hurt ourselves for fun
> Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
> Addicted to a lonely kind of love
> What I wanna know
>
> [Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
> Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid?
> Everything is going dark
> Nothing makes me sadder than my head
>
> [Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
> The emptiness is heavier than you think
>
> [Verse 2: Oliver Sykes]
> I'm tripping on the edge
> High as a kite, I'm never coming down
> And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels
> To be alone
>
> [Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
> So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
> Everything is going dark
> Nothing makes me sadder than my head
>
> [Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
> The emptiness is heavier than you think
>
> [Bridge: Oliver Sykes]
> Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
> Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
> Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
> Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
>
> [Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
> The emptiness is heavier than you think
> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
> The emptiness is heavier than you think
>
> [Outro: Oliver Sykes & Jordan Fish]
> Teardrops (Teardrops)
> Teardrops (Teardrops)
> I'm running outta teardrops (Teardrops)
> The emptiness is heavier than you think
