> i guess this is goodbye
> i guess we got what we deserved
> hold on to your heart
> it’s almost over
> i guess i should’ve known
> i guess a part of me still hoped
> broken from the start
> the beat in my chest
> sounds like a swan song
> you’ve got a bullet with my name on
>
> a moment of silence
> for a lifetime laid to waste
> now you’re underground
> still sounds like violence
> still got both feet in the grave
> you can’t drown it out 
>
> i’m dreaming backwards
> nobody answers
> i won’t look down
> again 
>
> i guess this is goodbye
> i guess we got what we deserved
> hold on to your heart
> it’s almost over
> (my soul’s collateral to you)
> i guess i should’ve known
> i guess a part of me still hoped
> broken from the start
> the beat in my chest
> sounds like a swan song
> you’ve got a bullet with my name on 
>
> i’m sorry,
> did my back hurt your knife?
> let me kiss it better
> this time i promise that i’ll die
> do the waltz
> with your alibi
> and if jesus christ returns
> well just kill the fucker twice 
>
> we get so lost, inside of your eyes
> we get so lost, still feel the butterflies
> but they’re gone 
>
> i guess this is goodbye
> i guess we got what we deserved
> hold on to your heart
> it’s almost over
> (my soul’s collateral to you)
> i guess i should’ve known
> i guess a part of me still hoped
> broken from the start
> the beat in my chest
> sounds like a swan song
> you’ve got a bullet with my name on
>
> your lullabies keep me awake
> i picked up your tab (paid in blood)
> saw things you never (never should)
> my bloody valentine of dirt 
>
> i’m dreaming backwards
> nobody answers
> i won’t look down
> again 
>
> i guess this is goodbye
> i guess we got what we deserved
> hold on to your heart
> it’s almost over
> (my soul’s collateral to you)
> i guess i should’ve known
> i guess a part of me still hoped
