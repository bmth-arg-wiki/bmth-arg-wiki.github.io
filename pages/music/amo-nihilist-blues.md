# Nihilist Blues ft. Grimes

> "I'm peeking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through."

Nihilist Blues is the third song from the album [Amo](amo), featuring Grimes. 
In the official lyric video, a strange message flashes. It seems to relate back to the ARG; however, there has been no
concrete evidence to prove so.

## Lyrics

<details class="lyrics">
    <summary>Lyrics</summary>

I’ve been climbing up the walls/
To escape the sinking feeling/ 
But I can’t hide from the nihilist at my door./
Buried in the basement floor/ 
Didn’t know what I had planted/
It blossomed with all the heart of a Cold War./
I’m a spirit in a tomb/
Won’t somebody raise the roof/ 
I’m going white, I’m going black, I’m going blue/
Do you mind if I’m exhumed?/
I’m the ashes in the plume/ 
I’m a beggar in the ruin/
I’m peeking out, I’m burning up, I’m shooting through/
I’m lonely for the true/ 
Paradise is in my soul/
And I’m terrified I can’t get out/ 
I’m lost in a labyrinth/ 
We are lost in a labyrinth/
Please don’t follow/ 
You were in my dream last night/ 
But your face was someone else’s/ 
A twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder./ 
Isolation neophyte,/
Too afraid to taste your conscience./ 
You march in the dark,/ 
Little lamb to the slaughter.

## Speculation

At 3:57 in the  [lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwzfR7-33Wc) we see the secret message flashing on the screen.

![Suspicious lines of text in Nihilist Blues (3:57)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/nihilist-blues/a_secretmessage.png)

When we zoom in, the message it becomes clearer:

> Angel crashes through mans window dystopian world
> 
> Man fixes her using cyborg parts angel is not thankful, angry she has been kept alive
> 
> Angel goes & kills ex boyfriends gangs ppl hack his augmented reality vision
> 
> Angel goes on killing spree, brings the man into the situation, finds out about something in his past involved? Murdered child
> 
> Conclusion angel was responsible

An interesting revenge story is laid out here, talking about cyborg parts 
and angels. It is currently unclear whether this story is about one of our ARG characters.
