{{ "
> [Verse 1]
> Some resist the future, some refuse the past
> Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
> That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
> So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash
>
> [Pre-Chorus]
> (How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
> You're like a phantom greeting me
> We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
> Stuck in a loop for eternity
>
> [Chorus]
> Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
> Will you retry or let the pain resume?
> I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
> (A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
> So come outside, it's time to see the tide
> It's out of sight, but never out of mind
> I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
>
> [Verse 2]
> Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
> But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
> And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
> And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show
>
> [Pre-Chorus]
> (How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
> You're like a phantom greeting me
> We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
> Stuck in a loop for eternity
>
> [Chorus]
> Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
> Will you retry or let the pain resume?
> I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
> (A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
> So come outside, it's time to see the tide
> It's out of sight, but never out of mind
> I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
> Yeah
>
> [Breakdown]
> Alright, you call this a connection?
> You call this a connection?
> You call this a connection? Okay
> You call this a connection?
> Oh, give me a break
> Oh, give me a break
> Oh, give me a break (Okay)
> Ugh, ooh
>
> [Chorus]
> Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
> Will you retry or let the pain resume?
> I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
> (A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
> So come outside, it's time to see the tide
> It's out of sight, but never out of mind
> I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
> A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
>
> [Outro]
> Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
> Will you retry or let the pain resume?
> I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
