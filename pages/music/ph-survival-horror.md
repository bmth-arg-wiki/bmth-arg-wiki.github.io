# POST HUMAN: Survival Horror

![](../../Resources/sof/img.png)

Post Human: Survival Horror (PH:SH) was the first Post Human album. Due to sharing 
a title with Post Human: Nex Gen (PH:NG), the connection between them is strongly implied. 

PH:SH was supposed to be the first of four albums

The art was made by Oliver's wife @alissic, who also made the cover for Post Human: 
Nex Gen.

## Speculation

- It is theorized that the girl on the cover of PH:SH (with the pink skin) is Sof 
from NexGen. The theory is supported by the fact that both characters have a third eye 
(with Sof's seemingly being sewn shut).
