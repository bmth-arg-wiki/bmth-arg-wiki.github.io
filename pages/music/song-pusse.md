```
- Talking:
It's simple folk-
[???]ogram therapeutic
It's DMT! And how could it help you access Youtopia?
Everybody stick around because we're gonna have some fun and look at this-
(Woman talking fast and jumbled)
I just wanted to try something new
Ecsta[sy]
You're si-
(Screaming)
GET AWAY, GET AWAY
(More distorted screaming)

I think the question on everyone's lips is 
what would you do for P.U.S.S-E?

(Music, flashes of "LET PUSS-E GUIDE YOU THERE")

Do you wanna join the millions of people that already ascended to Youtopia?

(Music, more imagery)

State of the art emotion simulator
Ancestors of the [yesteryears?]

- Singing:
THE BLOODS ON OUR HANDS
THE BLOODS ON OUR HANDS

- Talking:
WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR PUSS-E

[SYMBOLS FLASHING, GENXSIS VIDEO, HIDDEN IMAGERY]

Remember when you used to care?
Remember when it used to mean something?
Remember when it was as simple as the summer sunset?
No? [man grumbling] You will.
