# Sugar, Honey, Ice & Tea

Sugar, Honey, Ice & Tea (or SHIT), is the eighth song from the album [amo](./amo). 
The music video was directed and edited by [Circushead](https://circushead.co/pages/bring-me-the-horizon-sugar-honey-ice-tea).
It is one of the many projects he collaborated on with Bring Me The Horizon.

The music video contains some imagery that could be related to the ARG.
But as-of-yet, no direct connections have been established.

    <summary>Lyrics</summary>

Count down the thunder/
I think we’re too close for comfort/
So no don’t rock the boat/
& don’t calm the storm/
God already gave you his answer/ 
Blink, I’m sorry its over/ 
The whistle’s been blown, I/
Think you got the wrong number/ 
I’m breaking up/    
Want to make a connection/ 
Can’t get no reception/ 
Leave a message after the tone./
Cos it’s got my head my running 24/7/ 
I don’t know if I can figure it out/
It’s so messed up/
Only one thing I know for sure/
Were so full of/
Sugar, Honey, Ice & Tea./
Don’t move a muscle/
No we cant have a struggle/
But the “situation is in control”/
So play pretend that it’s all good/
you can tell the messiah/
His pants are on fire/
I politely decline I/
Gotta go I gotta/
stick my head in the sand and,/
block out all the sadness/
La la la la la la./
Cos it’s got my head like 24/7/
I don’t know if I can figure it out/
It’s all messed up/
Only one thing I know for sure/
And it’s got my head running 24/7/
I don’t reckon I can figure it out/
It’s all messed up/
Only one thing I know for sure/
& we all march on like we know the way to heaven/
Who the hell died and made you the king?/
We don’t know what we want/
But we know that we want it/
Yeah we want it/
Yeah we want it right now.
