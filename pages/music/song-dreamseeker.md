# [ost] Dreamseeker

> Let's begin

The first song on NexGen, being a short intro that leads into the song 
[Youtopia](../lore/youtopia).

The word Dreamseeker appears multiple times throughout the ARG, referring 
to a device of some kind. The [Dreadit](../for-sof/dreadit) file confirms 
that the Dreamseekers are devices being developed by [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).
