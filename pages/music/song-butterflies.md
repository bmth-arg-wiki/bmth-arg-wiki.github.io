## Interviews

> He continues: “The idea of that song is that I’m mankind, Amy is Mother Nature and 
it felt like the perfect thing to have the mother of rock singing it. It’s saying, 
‘This is the end of our world, so we need to try and find a new one’. [‘Survival Horror’] 
ends in a hopeful way. We hope that it will make people want to do something.”

> Intro: Amy Lee
> Ooh-ooh, ooh
> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
> Ooh-ooh, ooh
> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
>
> Verse 1: Amy Lee
> On the verge of no return, why'd you keep fucking it up?
> Don't wanna have to bury you, but nothing seems to get through your skull
> One day, the only butterflies left will be in your chest
> As you march towards your death, breathing your last breath
> I hate to say 'I told you so,' but look how the bruises show
>
> Chorus: Amy Lee
> Tell me, how's it gonna feel
> Without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
> Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
> You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
> Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
> How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah-ah
> You know you can't breathe on your own
>
> Verse 2: Oli Sykes
> Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?
> The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook
> One day, the only butterflies left will be in our chests
> As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath
> I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell
>
> Chorus: Amy Lee, Oli Sykes, Amy Lee & Oli Sykes
> So tell me, how's it gonna feel without my arms
> Wrapped around, wrapped around you?
> Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
> You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
> Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
> I let you sink your fangs so deep, ah-ah
> You know you can't breathe on your own
> You know I can't breathe on my own
> How can you breathe on your own?
> How can I breathe on my own?
>
> Interlude: Amy Lee
> Oh, oh-oh-oh
>
> Outro: Amy Lee & Oli Sykes
> The sun is setting on our love, I fear
> Letting our loneliness out into the atmosphere
> The tide is turning on our chance to turn it 'round (Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air)
> I never thought I'd see my fingernails fall out (Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air)
> Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air
> Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air
