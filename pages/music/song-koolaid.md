# Kool-Aid (song)

Song on the album, previously released as the sixth and last single.

The 8-bit version of this song was released through the ARG website and 
has seen a few interesting changes. It also has [an official music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4NhAnnD0Q), 
as well as a [lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyacCX-CFUM).

## Relation to YOUtopia

Oli called YOUtopia and Kool-Aid two sides of the same coin in 
[an interview on NexGen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLAoyZ4geIA).

[YOUtopia is about a paradise/dream, while KoolAid is described as more of a coma.](ph-nex-gen#connections)

### 26-05-2024 Update

The Kool-Aid music on the website was updated: the note `crunchy crunchy` was removed, 
leaving the space for the note now empty. The audio is also different: 
now actually sounding like an 8-bit version of Kool-Aid.

### 27-05-2024 Update

This song is currently not on the website anymore, having been removed in an update 
that changed the information on the other songs.
