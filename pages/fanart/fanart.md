# Fanart

Welcome to our fan art page! [At the wiki](../about) we are big supporters of having welcoming community 
spaces, sharing information and theories.

On this page, we will experiment with hosting content from collaborations in the fan base. 
As you may have noticed, the banner on our front page is also an example of the Post Human 
artist community's talents.

## Oli's Birthday 2025

## Fan Efforts

The [Notion page](https://the-secret-tinfoil-society.notion.site/BRING-ME-THE-HORIZON-ARG-6c86ee58ee3b41a6b0c594cf59201d4b) 
from the Tinfoil Society (maintained by AstraNao), containing many of the theories the community has tinfoiled on.

We also recommend Ojimo's [Project Starjammers](https://dolomite-crayon-935.notion.site/n-A-138ede99c3e5808b8dbde089fe6aa38f), 
which is full of theories on Bring Me The Horizon's discography.
