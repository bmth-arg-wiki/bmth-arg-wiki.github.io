# Oli's Birthday 2025

![Happy Birthday Oil Skys <3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/art-assets/main/oli-bday-2025/bday-banner.png)

For Oli's birthday in 2025, the Post Human fans created some beautiful art to celebrate. The cards are all different 
versions of Oli, drawn by many talented artists. You will also find some lovely birthday messages from the fans here. 

Special thanks to the Artnam Community for working so hard on this project and always motivating our team and each other.
