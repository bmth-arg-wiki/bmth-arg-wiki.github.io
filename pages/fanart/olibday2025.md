    Just like him I specialize in extra dumb choices, which is why I relate to him so much in the lore. Also, when 
    can he and Skys kiss please?"

    content="But can we talk about Ikaro and how he also made a few not-so-smart choices? I mean, 
    his dad made some dumb mistakes and could have at least taught his son better. Even before Dallus' death 
    , which self-respecting AI developer would put someone like E.V.E. in charge? It seems the EU Guidelines for Trustworthy 
    AI are not canon in this universe. Or everyone is very dumb."

    title="🇺🇸 - The Big Toast (@bigtoasty)"
    content="Sometimes I still wonder about the Nex Gen toast. I wonder about the Church in general, seriously 
    we don't have much lore. And what about that insta post that conflicts? I'm pretty sure there were no toasters 
    in ancient times so it seems hardly relevant to rituals too. But who knows maybe the toast is a metaphor for how 
    toasted we are in today's society."
