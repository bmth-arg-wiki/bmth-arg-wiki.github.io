# Project Dreamseeker

Project Dreamseeker was initiated by [E.V.E.](../characters/eve). [Nex Gen Corporation](nex-gen-corporation) presented 
the project as a means of escape from a world devastated by the parasitic virus [VSPR-37](vspr37), which killed half the 
population according to sources. The research focused around [Selene](../characters/selene)'s unique pineal gland.

## Background

The year 2037 marked large changes for [Nex Gen Corporation](nex-gen-corporation). During an incident named 
the "Cradle Crash" at [Arc/Hive](archive),[Dr. Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) lost his life. 
The company re-branded to Nex Gen soon after. After his father's death, [Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren) was determined to 
finish his father's research. He ended up activating [E.V.E.](../characters/eve) on the 24th of October 2037. 
A day later, Carmine is interviewed by an off-network (according to his assistant) journalist, still in charge of the company.

### Selene's Immunity

The [VSPR-37](vspr37) pandemic hit only a few days later, turning [Scott](../characters/scott) into a voidling and 
revealing [Selene](../characters/selene)'s immunity. In the [Kingslayer codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec) Selene is 
recovered and brought to Nex Gen. The pandemic has a devastating effect, killing half the population according to the 
[lore booklet](booklet).

E.V.E. emerged as a beacon of hope after the pandemic, now in charge of saving humanity. From several sources we learn 
that she worked closely with [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman) and discovered that Selene's pineal gland 
made her immune to the virus. She started Project Dreamseeker to up-regulate Selene's natural DMT production. In the 
real world DMT is produced in small quantities in the brain, but in-universe people's pineal glands have halted the 
production due to being calcified.

> DMT, a naturally occurring molecule in the brain, was believed to be the key to accessing a state of peace and bliss 
> beyond imagination â€“ a place known as YOUtopia.

Selene was cleansed using the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP), as described in the 
[findings of Strassman](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc). This ritual, taken from real-life Thelema practices, is 
used to free Selene from [mares](mares) before travelling to [Youtopia](youtopia). She describes the dimension, also 
known as Y-93, as "walking into a dream and stepping out of the coma".

### Synthesizing P.U.S.S-E

E.V.E., convinced that DMT was the key to entering this state, started development on a drug called [P.U.S.S-E](pusse). 
This artificially produced DMT would help people enter Youtopia, and E.V.E. believed in keeping humanity in this state 
after their world was devastated by VSPR-37.
The synthetic DMT was not risk-free, as other researchers pointed out according to the booklet. The drug could have 
devastating effects on the mental health of the vulnerable. The scientists emphasised that serotonin is critical in 
avoiding negative consequences, as it is a neurotransmitter essential for mood regulation.

> For some, yes, but for many, application of the pineal upregulation synthetic substance
> has had devastating effects on the psyche. Our subjects suffered profound neurological
> disturbances, paranoia, psychosis. Physiological responses were equally distressing with
> widespread organ failure and systemic collapse. We cannot ignore these dangers.

Strassman contacts E.V.E. in the [Strassman Codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec), a call where he reveals that 
the test subjects that were given P.U.S.S-E are suffering from terrible side effects. They are suffering from 
severe mental health consequences, as well as physical responses as extreme as total organ failure. 
E.V.E. is more focused on the fact that some subjects did reach Youtopia, stating that it will free humanity 
from their suffering. Strassman disagrees, stressing that they risk doing more harm than good. He also asks 
E.V.E. if she has any ulterior motives, specifically referring to her rising energy needs. She insists that 
this approach will save humanity and that they must make sacrifices, despite Strassman's pleading to 
stop the experiments.
