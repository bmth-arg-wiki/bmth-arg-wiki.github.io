# DTC (Disunited Territories of Columbia)

> Disconnected and dominated by corporations, it's far from its former glory.
> 
> - [Sof](../characters/sof)

The DTC, or Disunited Territories of Columbia, are a fractured nation under a lot 
of stress. [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) is a very powerful corporation not only in the 
region, but world-wide.

***

## Backstory

The Disunited Territories of Columbia are a nation destroyed by war, the [VSPR-37](vspr37) pandemic 
and several other factors. [Sof](../characters/sof) remarks in her journal that the nation is 
dominated by corporations (like Nex Gen, previously [ARC/HIVE](archive)) and barely held together.

From their journal, we also learn Sof is living in the DTC and there at the moment of writing. 
They remark that the DTC is home to Nex Gen and "the remnants of its influence shape my life".

### The Public Execution (>2020)

The execution of a man on a show named "Faith Over Flesh" was the topic of the article [Faith on the Edge](../website/tdw-faithedge), 
by Gideon Mourningstone. The article was published on [the Daily Whisper](../website/webbrowser). Gideon is critical of the state of the DTC 
of this article, but does remark that the DTC's ethics boards raised concerns with the show. The death row inmate named 
Jonah expresses intent to be crucified publicly, promising spiritual highs and cathartic release. 
Gideon is critical about the practice, pointing out that Jonah has connections to Ecliptism, a shady sect that was formed 
by the [Cult of Mantra](mantra)'s more extremist followers. He claims that the cult of Mantra can be traced back to 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), who ordered [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document) at the end of 
2020 to have the DTC extract [Skys](../characters/skys), [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) and 
[Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman). Victor is also behind the airing of the show on Nex Gen's 
Mindstream and sees the execution as a convenient way to "deliver justice" and create a public spectacle.

### Lupamine Crisis (>2028)

While an exact timeline is unknown, we know that a [Lupamine](lupamine) epidemic spreads through the DTC 
after [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) becomes the first synthetic human in 2028. These [synths](synths) were thought to be 
immune to addiction, but Lupamine proved that this assumption was incorrect. The drug, developed by Nex Gen to tranquilize 
resurrected direwolves, was even more effective on the synthetic bodies.
The DTC responded to the growing crisis by classifying the drug as a Class A controlled substance, only allowing it to 
be legally used by the military. Despite the measures, the article claims 12% of the DTC population has 
tried Lupamine at least once.

### Gat3keeper Theme Park (2023-2051)

The DTC was home to the [Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper) theme park, with an article in the Daily Whisper 
describing the park's tragic history from 2023-2051. This was the DTC's most advanced theme park and an AI named Celesta 
controlled several of their rides. During this time, several system incidents caused 
horrific accidents in the park, with most of them rumored or confirmed to be malfunctions of Celesta AI. 
The park is sometimes also rumoured to be involved in [Lyra](../characters/lyra-lauren)'s death, after her father [Dallus](../characters/dallus-lauren) 
got into a crash while driving her and [Ren](../characters/ren) home.
