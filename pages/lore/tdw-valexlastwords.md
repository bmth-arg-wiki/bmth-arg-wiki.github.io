> ### Shoot me up with a big fat slug
> 
> Star Jayven Valex's Last Words Revealed: "Shoot me up with a big fat slug"
> 
> Jayven Valex, the rising star of DRIVD IT, tragically passed away in February after a fatal overdose of lupamine, 
> the controversial street drug derived from NEX GEN's military dyrewolf tranquilizer. Just before his death, 
> Valex allegedly asked his assistant, Clara Hynes, to "shoot me up with a big fat slug," referencing the dangerous dosage.
>
> The actor was found unresponsive in his home, with autopsy results pointing to the acute effects of lupamine. 
> Authorities arrested five suspects, including Dr. Marion Vale, Erik Cruz, and the notorious "Lupamine Queen," Jasmine Lorran. 
> Vale has now pled guilty to conspiracy, facing up to 10 years in prison.
>
> Originally developed to pacify bioengineered dyrewolves, lupamine was repurposed for street use, creating an epidemic 
> that has swept through the Disunited Territories of Columbia (DTC). The drug's dissociative effects have led to skyrocketing 
> deaths, with Valex's overdose bringing the dangers into the spotlight.
>
> Vale's co-conspirators, including Dr. Sal Marquez and Lorran, allegedly exploited Valex's addiction, pushing higher 
> doses for financial gain. Court documents reveal texts between Marquez and Lorran, mocking Valex's addiction and discussing profits.
>
> As the case unfolds, the spotlight on NEX GEN's questionable projects grows, raising alarms about how a military-grade 
> tranquilizer became a widespread narcotic.
