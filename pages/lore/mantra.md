![The Cult of Mantra](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/unbeleevable/gallery/cult-of-mantra.png)

The Neosages, better known as the Mantra, are a cult with their leader being
[Skys](../characters/skys). Skys is also in a band called 'Skys & the Starjammers',
we learn from the first [Unbeleevable episode](../for-sof/unbeleevable).

One of the files in the [FOR SOF](../for-sof) folder contains a [poster](../for-sof/skystarjammers) 
for the band, inviting people to their show at October Palace on the 19th of December 2004, where the Trinity would end 
up meeting and working together for the first time.

This is the same location where the October Massacre would later take place, an event we see in the [music video for Mantra](../music/amo-mantra), 
which signified the end of the cult.

## Backstory

The cult was started by a man named Skys, who was born with pink hair. His parents abandoned 
him at 8 years old. After this point he fell in with a group of 'nutters'
(as stated by Dr. Lee MD in [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable)) 
and traveled the world. In the second [Unbeleevable episode](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) we learn 
that Skys was involved with a man named Alby, who was like a mentor to him that he ended up leaving after a fight. 
We also learn more about what young Skys went through in his own [diary](../for-sof/skys-diary) and 
[the Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse).

At some point he then picked up a guitar and his band got somewhat successful.

### Project Kingslayer

[Project Kingslayer](incident-kingslayer) was a project to gain ancient power through ritualistic torture. 
[Unbeleevable 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3) reveals that Project Kingslayer started in 2015 with 
[Skys](../characters/skys)' loyal follower [Alfgram](../characters/alfgram) as its patient zero.

[Ecliptism](ecliptism) formed the core beliefs of the cult, and their [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse) 
describes some of the seven rituals the cult ended up practicing to achieve purity for enlightenment.

![Sof on Project Kingslayer in her journal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/mantra/kingslayer_sof_journal.png)

[Project D.U.S.T. proposal](../for-sof/project_dust) is [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine)'s 
continuation of the project, after gaining access to insider cult knowledge through [Operation Trinity](operation-trinity).

It is stated that the Mantra cult was able to fend off hundreds of troops, seemingly using a psychological weapon like
the [mares](mares) to paralyse the troops with fear. This project was the source of the cult's powers.

### Fall of the Cult

In the music video for [Mantra](../music/amo-mantra) we see the fall of the cult in an event that is later named 
the October Massacre, at the October Palace, the same place where the [collaboration between the trinity started in 2004](../for-sof/skystarjammers).
We see Skys in his office (seemingly) taking Mantra and dying. He is found by a woman in red, who we learn is called Medea 
at the end of the second Unbeleevable episode, and a funeral is planned. From the same episode, we also learn that 
Medea was trying to take down the cult from the inside.

The music video also shows us the funeral, where the cult members all take Mantra and start 
convulsing violently. A mysterious electricity-like power knocks out or kills all the cult members. Medea seems to be 
targeted specifically after the other cult members fall down, with her head eventually exploding.
We then see Skys smirk in his coffin, showing that he is not dead.

The [Trinity document](../for-sof/trinity_document) also reveals that Skys' death was indeed faked and that he 
was extracted from Novosovia in Operation Trinity.

### Arc/Hive Gets Involved

[ARC/HIVE](archive) was after the practices of the Neosages/Mantra cult and the research from Project Kingslayer, 
extracting Skys along with [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) and [Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman). 
The operation took place around the 25th December 2020 and was ordered by [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine). 
It formed the foundation for [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust), which would expand on the research from 
project Kingslayer, as well as the application of mares as weapons.

However, Dallus later notes in [his diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) that Skys is in a coma and his body is "useless". In Rebecca's 
[second Grumblr entry](../for-sof/grumblr2) Skys gets another shot at life as a synth(etic human). He starts laughing 
before begging for death. Strassman and Dallus argue over how Skys got into this state and Rebecca states “I’ll do it.”.

joinmantra.org was a promotion for the music video for [Mantra (song)](../music/amo-mantra).

*An invitation to salvation* is shown on the webpage, along with the Mantra logo.
The website contained a slightly moving image of Oli in the music video.
It was revealed to be a teaser for the song.

The website sadly does not exist in this form,
but it can be viewed on the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190408225654/http://www.joinmantra.org/).
