## Backstory

The origins of the story take place in Novosovia, where all of our Trinity members are located 
at the time of [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document). 

[Skys](../characters/skys) was born here, with a condition named Radiogenic Leukotrichia, something 
he was feared for. The culture in the country caused him to be rejected. His parents abandoned him at 8 years old, 
after which he [ended up in Ingleterra](../for-sof/skys-diary).

The October Palace, known for the [Mantra cult](mantra), is located in Novosovia. While the government 
was not fond of the cult, they managed to exist for over a decade in the country.
