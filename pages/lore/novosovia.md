Novosovia is a fictional Eastern-European country. They are at war with Ingleterra for 
at least part of the story.

Many of the important characters in the story are from Novosovia, including 
[Skys](../characters/skys), [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), 
[Dr. Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren), [Elena Lauren](../characters/elena-lauren) 
and [Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren).

## Backstory

> After the nuclear fallout of World War 3, Novosovia was a place tougher than your Grandad’s old leather boots. 
> You see, the government weren’t just running the show, they were using fundamentalist religion to keep everyone 
> in line.
> 
> Out of the ashes of this radioactive mess, a special little lad was born. Why was he so special? 
> One word: pink hair.
> 
> - [Dr. Lee MD](../characters/lee-md) in [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable)

Novosovia is a fictional Eastern-European country. The country is under constant stress, being described as 
hyper-religious by both [Sof](../characters/sof) and Dr. Lee MD. The country was suffering from the effects of 
radiation as a consequence of World War 3. The radioactive fall-out, combined with a genetic component, 
caused [Skys](../characters/skys) to be born with a condition named Radiogenic Leukotrichia. In the year 2037 
in New Elysium, there would eventually be a [newspaper](../for-sof/thesciencestudy) describing this phenomenon.

[Strassman](../characters/strassman) was born in the country in the small city of Zelenopol, according to the 
[lore booklet](booklet). [Sof's journal](journal) confirms that Dallus is also from
the country and would establish his family here, until the fall of Mantra would force them to re-locate.

> Mothers aren’t supposed to leave, or so the mindflicks would have you believe. Unless of course, they’re
> addicted to lupamine or double agents for the Novosovians.

Sof was born in Nex Gen's labs in the DTC, living close to [New Elysium](new-elysium) at the time of
writing their journal. From their writing, it seems like there is some hostility between the
residents of the DTC and Novosovia.

### Pink Hair

In the Novosovian culture at the time of Skys' youth (approximately the 90's), both the conditions that cause
white hair and pink hair (Radiogenic Leukotrichia) are feared, with Sof explaining pink hair would get you labeled
as a witch. From the newspaper in 2037, it seems like the Novosovians still fear the condition.

Skys' parents decided to hide him away from the world, frequently locking him up. On his 8th birthday, they kicked 
Skys out of the house. From [Skys diary](../for-sof/skys-diary) we learn that he travelled betweens towns in Novosovia, 
just trying to get by. Eventually he ended up hiding on a big ship, which brought him to Ingleterra until he would 
return in 2004.

### Mantra Cult

The October Palace, known for the [Mantra cult](mantra), is located in Novosovia. The cult was located here 
after Skys returned to Novosovia with his band in 2004. While the government was not fond of the cult, they managed 
to exist for over a decade in the country.

During [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document) in 2020, several of our characters are extracted and brought 
to the [DTC](../lore/dtc). The Operation brings not only Strassman, Dallus and Skys to the DTC, but also Dallus' family 
and some children referred to as "the Special Six" in [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust). It is unknown what 
happens to Strassman's family, his wife Ava and child Angel, since Ava is dead and Angel is missing by the time 
Dallus writes [his diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) in January 2021.

During the time of the cult in Novosovia, a corporate off-shoot of the cult is established. [Genxsis](../lore/church) 
would eventually go global, but started from the research here according to Sof's journal.
