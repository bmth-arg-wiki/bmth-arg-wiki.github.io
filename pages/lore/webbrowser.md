# Web Browser - Spyder

Spyder is the web browser of the Multidimensional Navigator 8, which was unusable until September 30th.

It's accessed through this spider-web icon at the top left of the screen.

It has had multiple iterations since the ARG started.

## Version 1

The first version of the Spyder homepage was pretty simple and had a url that lead nowhere.

The error code seems to be related to [Top 10 statues that cried blood](../music/song-top10).

## Version 2

{% include info.html 
title="Spoiler Warning!" 
icon="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"
content="Version 2 contains slight spoilers for the Dreaddit file. If you want to avoid them, we suggest jumping directly to [Version 3](#Version-3)." 
%}

Spyder's second iteration looked the same as the first with the only exception being the new url in the search bar.
It now read: ```"https://www.dreaddit.com/d/conspiracy/comments/1d1b2c2a"```.
That new address proved useful for the [Dreaddit file](../for-sof/dreadit).

## Version 3

The third (and current) iteration of the browser was revealed on September 30th when the first [wifi password](wifi#nxEcoSubLevel) was found.
The entire page got a redesign and M8 talks about it.

### Firewall

If the search button is clicked, the page changes and flashes a message saying this url has been blocked. 
This action prompts more dialog from M8.

I used to use it to watch Brasilian fart por- Brasilian farming documentaries, ahahahah… 
Anyhoo! If you can get your hands on a PISS, we should be able to bypass this no problemo.”
