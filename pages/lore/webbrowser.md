# Web Browser - Spyder

Spyder is the web browser of the [Multidimensional Navigator 8](../webpage) , which was unusable until September 30th, 
as we did not have the [wifi](wifi) passwords.

It's accessed through this intricate looking icon at the top left of the screen. 

![spyder icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/webbrowser/spyder300x300.png)

It has had multiple iterations since the ARG started.

## Version 1

Spyder's icon used to be this simple blue spiderweb:

The homepage was also pretty simple and had a url that lead nowhere.

The error code seemed to be related to [Top 10 statues that cried blood](../music/song-top10).

## Version 2

{% include info.html 
title="Spoiler Warning!" 
icon="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"
content="Version 2 contains slight spoilers for the Dreaddit file. If you want to avoid them, we suggest jumping directly to [Version 3](#Version-3)." 
%}

Spyder's second iteration looked the same as the first with the only exception being the new url in the search bar.
It now read: ```"https://www.dreaddit.com/d/conspiracy/comments/1d1b2c2a"```.
That new address proved useful for the [Dreaddit file](../for-sof/dreadit).

## Version 3.1

The third (and current) iteration of the browser was revealed on September 30th when the first [wifi password](wifi#nxEcoSubLevel) was found.
The entire page got a redesign and M8 talks about it. 
We now need access codes to use the internet, which we do not have yet.

### Firewall

If the search button is clicked, the page changes and flashes a message saying this url has been blocked. 
This action prompts more dialog from M8.

I used to use it to watch Brasilian fart por- Brasilian farming documentaries, ahahahah… 
Anyhoo! If you can get your hands on a PISS, we should be able to bypass this no problemo.”

## Version 3.2

On December 15th 2024, thanks to the [Coordinates file](../for-sof/cities-coordinates) from the [Inventory](../for-sof/for-sof),
the Spyder access codes were found on cards across three cities: Berlin, Sheffield, and Mexico City.

{% include gallery.html folder="lore/webbrowser/accesscodes" %}

![clear access codes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/webbrowser/login.png)

Upon entering these numbers, the browser loads a page from a newspaper called 'The Daily Whisper', 
whose name is a play on the real life publication 'The Daily Mail'.
