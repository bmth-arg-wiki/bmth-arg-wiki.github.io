# Web Browser - Spyder

Spyder is the web browser of the Multidimensional Navigator 8, which was unusable until September 30th.

It's accessed through this spider-web icon at the top left of the screen.

It has had multiple iterations since the ARG started.

## Version 1

The first version of the Spyder homepage was pretty simple and had a url that lead nowhere.

The error code seems to be related to Top 10 statues that cried blood.

## Version 2

content="Version 2 contains slight spoilers for the Dreaddit file. If you want to avoid them, we suggest jumping directly to [Version 3](#Version-3)." 
%}

Spyder's second iteration looked the same as the first with the only exception being the new url in the search bar.
It now read: "https: //w ww.dreaddit.com/d/conspiracy/comments/1d1b2c2a".
That new address proved useful for the [Dreaddit file](../for-sof/dreadit).
