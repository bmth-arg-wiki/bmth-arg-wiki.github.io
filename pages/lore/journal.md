>Perhaps I’m beginning to understand why every one here obsessed over writing down every fleeting thought. 
> There’s a strange satisfaction in it. I’d argue it’s even logical, 
> given that I have three irrefutable reasons for this hatred.
>
>Reason one:
>
>She left. Mothers aren’t supposed to leave, or so the mindflicks would have you believe. 
> Unless of course, they’re addiscted to lupamine or double agents for the Novosovians. 
> Truth be told, for all I know, she’s an Ecliptist wreckhead, 
> covertly eliminating Novi Dominarchs and their families in their sleep, 
> just to satisfy her all-consuming desire to loophole on wolf tranq.
>
>Or maybe she’s the voidling that lingers by the east wing viewport, gray and night, chanting in tongues. 
> Some rancid, sour hymn from a place where the sun never shone. 

> ## Pages 3 & 4
>
>Mad thoughts, I know. And yet I can’t help but cling to them, like a defective program that won’t shut down, 
> no matter how many times I attempt to force quit. I’m quite sure it’s not her; after all, 
> the voidling doesn’t share our pink hair. Although come to think of it, 
> I don’t believe the wraith has any hair at all. Or eyes. Just teeth. Rows of them, crooked and jagged, 
> like someone or something specifically engineered that creature to shred through wet metal. 
> For some reason I can’t quite figure, imagining that thing is my mother gives me a weird, fleeting warmth. 
> Maybe it’s because I never really knew her. 
>
>Better a sad story than one that makes no sense.
>
>Which leads me to reason two:
>
>She once told me she hoped I’d someday understand her reasons for leaving. 
> But if that’s true, why the hex did she make it such an unending, soul-griding slog? 
> Why all the biometric locks, the cryptic glyphs, the inverted waveforms and quantum spectrums, 
> the data shards scattered across fractured reality nodes? What did you think I couldn’t handle, Mother?
>
>You left me in this rotting mausoleum of a lab, alone, under constant threat from voidlings and oblivion knows what else. 
> I spend my days rewiring circuits and scavenging parts just to survive another day. 
> And for what? To decode your endless riddles, 
> no closer to understanding what was so monumental that you couldn’t just say it?
>
>Am I supposed to shower you with gratitude for leaving me at an abandoned NEX GEN lab, 
> with nothing but these digital dregs? Codex recordings of massacres, articles about some SYNTH-turned-fashion-model, 
> random fragments of people’s lives-shattered, stitched together, and then torn apart again? 
> I may as well be trying to decipher one of M*’s headache inducing jokes.

> ## Pages 5 & 6
>
>And that brings me to reason three:
>
>Out of all the possible relics of this world you could’ve left me, why her? 
> M8, thisobnoxious, malfunctioning, state-of-the-art scrap heap that has the audacity to test my patience with her Gen D ‘humour’. 
> And do not get me started on how agonisingly slow she is. 
> I feel like I’m trapped in a steampunk novella. 
> I know I have to keep her on my side for the sake of progress, 
> but if I have to fein laughter at one more of her “Why did the synth initiate a cross boundary traversal?” jokes, 
> I might actually forfeit whatever’s left of my sanity.
>
>But anyway, this mind-dump was not the reason I opened this new app.
>
>The Nexlink has come back online, and for the last five gray and nights, I’ve been doomscrolling on Troff, 
> immersed in the mindless spectacle of Carmalites diving through waterfalls or S-Pop bands with their artificially sculpted faces. 
> Meaningless. All of it.
>
>I also have a desire to make something called hummus. 
> They say it’s better to make the chickpeas from norganic LumaCubes, 
> but I would have to settle for nNutrigen-printed beans, assuming the antique even has the foodprint in its databank. 
>
>No. Enough distractions. It’s time to focus. Time to organise. 
> I’ve gathered enough fragments: data shards, encrypted memories, codex recordings. 
> Now I’ll categorise them all, piece by piece, index them chronologically, cross-referencing with known events. 
> Create a framework. A narrative, perhaps. Maybe then I’ll uncover the patterns buried beneath the chaos. 
> Perhaps I’ll even run predictive algorithms, generate outcomes from the tangled mess of timelines. 
> I’m actually rather excited.
>
>Maybe that kid on J@M was right, and I am the strangest 8-year-old ever. What do you expect? 
> I’m an orphan raised by a psychopathic robot.
>
>Speaking of, I should have M8 assist and automate some of the data sorting to lighten the load.

> ## Pages 7 & 8
>
>On second thoughts, I think I’d rather suffer in peace.
>
>I’ll create separate entries for the key players, locations/Incidents, and assets that don’t have clear timestamps yet.

>
> Key Players
>
>Selene
>
>-	Who She Is: My mother, whose voice I only know from a single audio log. 
>Her significance lies in her immunity to VSPR-37 and her involvement with NEX GEN’s experiments on Youtopia.
>-	Where From: New Elysium, most likely a NEX GEN-built community.
>-	Status: Unknown-she abandoned me shortly after I was born.
>-	Significance: Selene’s immunity to the virus is critical.
>
>[Drawing of Selene]

> ## Pages 13 & 14
>
>-	Who He Is: My mother’s best friend and one of the first known victims of the VSPR-37 virus. 
>He was bitten and transformed into a voidling, a flesh-hungry monster.
>-	Where From: New Elysium, the same location as my mother.
>-	Significance: His infection was right at the beginning of the virus outbreak that would devastate the world. 
>His relationship with my mother and his early involvement with NEX GEN meds could hold more answers to the virus’s origin.
>
>[Drawing of Scott with his dog Oskar]

>  ## Pages 15 & 16
>
>-	Who It Is: The 8-Line AI created by Ren Lauren, and also the bane of my existence. 
>M8 handles data decryption but tests my patience with her terrible jokes and glitchy personality.
>-	Where From: Created by Ren at NEX GEN.
>-	Status: Active, but I wish she wasn’t sometimes. 
>-	Significance: M8 helps me unravel the loophole left by NEX GEN. 
>Despite her irritating personality, I need her to access hidden files, 
>though she makes my life more difficult than necessary. 
>
>[Drawing of M8]
>
> ## Pages 17 & 18
>
>E.V.E
>
>-	Who She Is : EVE is an advanced research engine birthed from Dallus Lauren’s work, and completed by Ren. 
>She operated on a quantum level, processing not just data but emotions, making her incredibly dangerous if unchecked. 
>Strassman suggested she may even be using humans as a personal power source, though it’s hard to tell what’s true. 
>-	Where From: NEX GEN headquarters, likely developed during ARC/HIVE’s final years.
>-	Status: Active and possibly in control of NEX GEN’s future decisions.
>-	Significance: EVE’s existence blurs the line between technology and sentience. 
>She’s likely influencing or even directing the company’s most dangerous experiments, including Youtopia.
>
>[Drawing of E.V.E.]

> ## Pages 19 & 20
>
>Dr. Karl Strassman
>
>-	Who He is: One of the founders of MANTRA, and considered the father of neospiritualism. 
>He’s one of the most vital minds behind NEX GEN’s bleak experiments, and a figure drenched in mystery and madness.
>-	Where From: Novosovia originally, later relocated to the DTC.
>-	Status: Unknown: he fell off the grid, and I’m not sure if he’s alive or worse.
>-	Significance: His work on spiritual science and dark dimensions like Youtopia connects nearly every piece of this nightmare.
>
>[Drawing of Dr. Karl Strassman]

> ## Pages 21 & 22 
>
>Dr. Lee M.D
>
>-	Who He Is: Host of Unbeleevable, the conspiracy theory show that exposed crucial info about NEX GEN, 
>GENXSIS, and Skys. Though eccentric, his insights have proven invaluable.
>-	Where From: Unknown, though that accent is definitely not from the DTC.
>-	Status: Missing, I worry he has been silenced by NEX GEN. I hope not, at least not before he finished season 1. 
>-	Significance: He connected vital dots, shedding light on Skys’ powers, 
>NEX GEN’s involment in neospiritualism, and EVE.
>
>[No drawing of Dr. Lee M.D., just a big question mark] 

> ## Pages 23 & 24
>
>Dr. Elias Mortem
>
>-	Who He Is : Lead researcher at NEW gen, specifically tied to Project D.U.S.T. 
>and the hexed experiments MANTRA conducted. He’s an absolute westhead, 
>responsible for experiments involving pain and torture to “access heaven.”
>-	Where From: Worked under NEX GEN and its predecessor ARC/HIVE.
>-	Status: Apparently slaughtered during the Chapel Incident.
>-	Significance: Mortem played a pivotal role in NEX GEN’s worst experiments, pushing science beyond sanity. 
>His work helped make the Mares and nightmare-like dimensions a bleak reality.
>
>[No drawing of Dr. Elias Mortem, just a big question mark]

> ## Pages 25 & 26
>
>Dr. Dallus Lauren
>
>-	Who He Is : Dallus was one of NEX GEN’s leading scientists, the mind behind some of the most groundbreaking tech, 
>like MOXY PACKS and SYNTHS. Also, Skys’ ally in the Cult of MANTRA: science and neospiritualism. 
>-	Where From: Novosovia, though his work took him all over, ending up with NEX GEN.
>-	Status: Dead: likely as a result of the very experiments he was part of.
>-	Significance: Dallus’s inventiions saved lives, 
>but his deeper involvement in MANTRA’d hexed up experiments leaves a shadow over his legacy.
>
>[Drawing of Dr. Dallus Lauren]

> ## Pages 27 & 28
>
>Lyra Lauren
>
>-	Who She Is: Daughter of Dallus and Elena Lauren, born during their escape from Novosovia.
>-	Where From: Unknown-most likely New Elysium.
>-	Status: Unknown, as she vanishes from the records after her birth.
>-	Significance: Lyra’s birth coincided with one of NEX GEN’s darkest times. 
>Her existence is a mystery, and wether she survived the chaos remains unanswered.
>
>[No drawing of Lyra Lauren, just a big question mark]

> ## Pages 29 & 30
>
>Elena Lauren
>
>-	Who She Is: Wife of Dallus Lauren and mother of Lyra. She gave birth to Lyra during their harrowing escape from Novosovia.
>-	Where From: Novosovia, later evacuated to NEX GEN.
>-	Status: Unknown. She fades from records after the escape.
>-	Significance: Elena is tied to Dallus’ emotional turmoil and was present for major events. 
>She’s significant as a part of Dallus’ motivations and guilt, 
>especially surrounding their daughter’s birth during their escape.
>
>[No drawing of Elena Lauren, just a big question mark]

> ## Pages 31 & 32
>
>Ikaro Lauren
>
>-	Who They Are: Ikaro, known as Ren, is Dallus Lauren’s child and a brilliant mind in their own right. 
>Ren is responsible for creating the entire 8-line, including the wonderful M8 (thanks so much for that, by the way), 
>and for activating EVE, which changed everything. But I’ve found conflicting evidence about their gender, 
>so I’m not even sure.
>-	Where From: Likely Novosovia, but they spent most of their life at NEX GEN.
>-	Status: Missing/Dead/Idk.
>-	Significance: Ren’s inventions are pivotal in shaping everything NEX GEN is popular for today. 
>Their connection to EVE and the 8-line makes them one I need to keep an eye on.
>
>[Drawing of Ikaro Lauren]

> ## Pages 33 & 34
>
>Rebecca Sinclair
>
>-	Who She Is: An employee at ARC/HIVE, later known as NEX GEN. 
>Diagnosed with a terminal illness (CERS), Rebecca became the first successful SYNTH-essentially a synthetic human. 
>She was also featured as a PR symbol for NEX GEN’s advancements.
>-	Where From: Presumably the DTC
>-	Status: Presumed alive as a SYNTH, though I haven’t found recent updates.
>-	Significance: Rebecca’s transformation into a SYNTH was revolutionary, 
>showcasing NEX GEN’s dangerous experimentation with synthetic life. She’s a pivotal part of their image and agenda.
>
>[No drawing og Rebecca Sinclair, just a big question mark]

> ## Pages 35 & 36
>
>Victor Carmine
>
>-	Who He Is: Victor Carmine is the elusive, calculating leader of NEX GEN, previously known as ARC/HIVE. 
>He seems to have been orchestrating everything from behind the scenes, 
>pulling strings even before it all went to oblivion.
>-	Where From: Unknown, guessing somewhere in the DTC.
>-	Status: Unknown: there’s speculation that he might not even be in control anymore.
>-	Significance: Victor is the mastermind behind many of NEX GEN’s darkest projects. 
>He orchestrated the extraction of Skys, Strassman, and Dallus, and likely had a role in their subsequent research. 
>His motivations? Seemingly to push human evolution, even at unimaginable costs.

> ## Pages 37 & 38
>
>Skys
>
>-	Who He Is: Skys, what a mindrot. He has the same pink hair problem as me and my mother, 
>and by all accounts a seriously hexed up childhood, which lead to an obsession with pain, 
>which in turn gave him powers (can’t make it up). 
>He became the leader of the Cult of MANTRA alongside Dallus and Strassman.
>-	Where From: Novosovia
>-	Status: Unknown, last known to be in a coma after the collapse of MATRA. 
>His body was shipped to NEX GEN, but that’s all I have so far.
>-	Significance: Skys’ influence is huge. His beliefs and abilities shaped the cult that started it all, 
>and his connection to spiritual and scientific practices blurred the lines between mysticism and 
>NEX GEN’s corporate machinations.
>
>[Drawing of Skys]

> ## Pages 39 & 40
>
>FANTOM
>
>-	What It Is: NEX GEN’s covert operations unit, responsible for monitoring and, if necessary, 
>extracting (or erasing) key individuals.
>-	Where From: NEX GEN’s internal ops team.
>-	Status: Active, and probably still keeping tabs on me.
>-	Significance: FANTOM plays a key role in monitoring and containing outbreaks, 
>as well as conducting shady missions like the extraction of my mother during the voidling crisis. 
>They’re responsible for some of the more secretive and sinister aspects of NEX GEN’s actions.

> ## Pages 41 & 42
>
>Locations
>
>October Palace
>
>-	What It Is: The site of Skys’ secret concert with his band Starjammers in 2004, 
>a pivotal moment before he became entangled with Dallus and Strassman.
>-	Where: Novosovia
>-	Status: A historical landmark
>-	Significance: This as a key event where Skys likely met the others, 
>setting in motion the events that led to the formation of the Cult of MANTRA and, eventually, NEX GEN’s involvement. 
>Maybe it was their base?

> ## Pages 43 & 44
>
>Novosovia
>
>-	What It Is: A hyper-religious and war-torn country far east of the mainland, 
>deeply opposed to the Cult of MANTRA’s activities, where much of the early story unfolds.
>-	Status: Likely in a state of collapse after years of war and conflict.
>-	Significance: The birthplace of the Cult of MANTRA and Skys. 
>Novosovia’s political and religious climate drove much of the conflict and eventually forced the cult 
>members to flee and join ARC/HIVE.

> ## Pages 45 & 46
>
>New Elysium
>
>-	What It Is: A mysterious, likely NEX GEN-built suburb that served as my mother’s home and 
>possibly a surveillance hub for NEX GEN.
>-	Where: Just miles away from where I currently live.
>-	Status: Abandoned.
>-	Significance: New Elysium feels more like a carefully orchestrated experiment than a community. 
>My mother lived here, and it seems like NEX GEN was monitoring everything within its walls.

> ## Pages 47 & 48
>
>The DTC (Disunited Territories of Columbia)
>
>-	What It Is: A fractured nation once known for its unity. 
>Now it’s a patchwork of territories barely held together by corporate powers like NEX GEN. 
>Oh, it’s also where I live. If you can call it living.
>-	Where: Here.
>-	Status: Disconnected and dominated by corporations, it’s far from its former glory.
>-	Significance: The DTC is home to NEX GEN’s headquarters and the remnants of its influence shape my life.

> ## Pages 49 & 50
>
>YOUTOPIA/Y-93
>
>-	What It Is: An elusive and possibly alternate dimension, 
>sought after by NEX GEN as a higher state of existence or utopia. Pretty convinced y-93 is its code name.
>-	Where: No idea, still hard to fathom it’s real.
>-	Status: ???
>-	Significance: As hard as it is to believe in Youtopia, it comes up so many times from various sources, 
>it’s getting hard to ignore.

> ## Pages 51 & 52
>
>Groups
>
>Cult of MANTRA
>
>-	What It Is: A spiritual cult formed by Skys, Dallus, and Strassman, 
>originally rooted in neospiritualism and the pursuit of higher dimensions.
>-	Where: Novosovia.
>-	Status: Dissolved after Skys fell into a coma.
>-	Significance: MANTRA wasn’t just a cult: 
>it was a testing ground for hellish experiments and ideas that later influenced ARC/HIVE’s (NEX GEN) operations. 
>Wether it started [cuts off like that]

> ## Pages 53 & 54
>
>GENXSIS
>
>-	What It Is: A secretive, corporate-backed offshoot of MANTRA, 
>likely created within NEX GEN’s structure as the cult dissolved.
>-	Where: Global, though rooted in the research from Novosovia.
>-	Status: Unknown, but likely still influential.
>-	Significance: GENXSIS represents the shift from a spiritual cult to an AI-driven organization seeking to 
>transcend human limitations. It’s also tied to NEX GEN’s technological ambitions. 
>I don’t know all that much. Yet.

> ## Pages 55 & 56
>
>ARC/HIVE / NEX GEN
>
>-	What It Is: A global tech conglomerate led by Victore Carmine, 
>initially named ARC/HIVE before its rebranding to NEX GEN following significant events. 
>Known for its research in AI, biotech, and military tech.
>-	Where: worldwide presence, with key operations in the DTC.
>-	Status: Thriving, controlling much of the world’s technology and influencing global politics.
>-	Significance: Central to nearly every discovery I’ve made, from the creation of EVE to the viral outbreak.
