# The Rise of Synthetic Humans

> Coming soon!

"The Rise of Synthetic Humans" is an in-universe article discussing [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren)'s [synth](synths) 
project. It tells us more about how the synthetic humans are made, what they can do and the ethical dilemma's that come 
with them. The article also hints at a darker fate for [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca), which we learn more about 
in the [article about Lupamine](tdw-riseoflupamine).
