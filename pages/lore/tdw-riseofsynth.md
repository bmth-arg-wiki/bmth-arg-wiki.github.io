> She quickly became a sensation, a walking testament to the future of transhumanism, but the price of this immortality soon became evident.

"The Rise of Synthetic Humans" is an in-universe article discussing [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren)'s [synth](synths) 
project. It tells us more about how the synthetic humans are made, what they can do and the ethical dilemma's that come 
with them. The article also hints at a darker fate for [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca), which we learn more about

> ### Synthetic Humans
>
> The Rise of Synthetic Humans: Redefining Humanity 
> 
> In 2028, NEX GEN unveiled the world's first fully functioning synthetic human—a groundbreaking fusion of artificial 
> intelligence and human consciousness. The synthetic project was spearheaded by renowned scientist Dr. Dallus Lauren, 
> whose innovations in neural transfers and biotechnology allowed humans to transcend the limits of biology.
>
> Rebecca Sinclair became the first public synthetic, her consciousness uploaded to a perfected synthetic body after she 
> was diagnosed with a terminal illness. She quickly became a sensation, a walking testament to the future of transhumanism, 
> but the price of this immortality soon became evident.
>
> Promises of Immortality—and the Dark Side
> 
> The SYNTH project was heralded as the future of human evolution. These synthetic bodies, immune to disease, aging, 
> and the environmental damage plaguing the world, offered humanity a chance at indefinite survival. 
> The ability to transfer one's consciousness into a synthetic shell promised eternal life, heightened intelligence, 
> and physical perfection. But as with any breakthrough, the dark side quickly emerged.
>
> The Ethical Dilemmas of Synthetic Life
>
> The rise of synthetics also brought with it ethical dilemmas. Could humanity maintain its essence when housed in artificial shells? 
> Questions of identity, autonomy, and the potential exploitation of synthetic bodies haunted the project. Additionally, 
> NEX GEN's secretive practices, including the forced uploads of dying individuals without consent, 
> sparked worldwide protests and moral outrage.
>
> As synthetic humans became more common, these issues continued to fester. While many applauded the possibilities of 
> transcending human limitations, others feared the loss of individuality and the creeping corporatization of human life itself.
>
> What's Next for Synthetic Humanity?
>
> The SYNTH revolution is far from over. NEX GEN's technological breakthroughs continue to reshape society, 
> with more and more individuals opting for synthetic bodies to escape death and disease. However, 
> with figures like Rebecca Sinclair serving as a cautionary tale, the true cost of synthetic life remains unclear. 
> Will humanity evolve into something greater, or will the price of immortality be too high for even the strongest minds to bear?
