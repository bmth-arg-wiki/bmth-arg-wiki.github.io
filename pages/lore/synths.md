# SYNTHs

SYNTH, or Synthetic Neurological Transference Human, was a project by [ARC/HIVE](archive)/[Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) 
corporation, happening around their re-brand. [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) was the scientist behind the 
project, notably giving [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) her synth body after she became terminally ill.

## Backstory

Ren mentions the SYNTH project in his [log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log), as a source of inspiration for his own work. 
Dallus Lauren was Ren's father, with his full name being Ikaro Lauren.

Lab assistant [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) became terminally ill with the 'big C' or Chronic Environmental Respiratory 
System, being diagnosed in 2027. Rebecca's next appearance is in the [Tekka interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview) in 2028, 
with her now being the first human successfully transferred into a synth body. Nex Gen even encourages her to smoke as a marketing 
ploy, intending to show how indestructible the synth bodies are.

The [webbrowser Spyder](webbrowser) paints a much darker picture of the project. While synths are thought to be immune to addiction, 
Rebecca's shining hope for humanity turns into [Lupamine](lupamine) addiction instead. It even turns out that her synth 
body amplified the effects of the drug, making her even more violent and prone to addiction. Other synths, called SIMPs (or Subservient 
Intimate Machine Partners), are used to satisfy the depravity of others. Nex Gen also develops synths as a national security 
weapon, creating a type of combat synth.
