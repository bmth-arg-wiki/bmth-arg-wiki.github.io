# SYNTHs

SYNTH, or Synthetic Neurological Transference Human, was a project by [ARC/HIVE](archive)/[Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) 
corporation, happening around their re-brand. [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) was the scientist behind the 
project, notably giving [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) her synth body after she became terminally ill.

## Backstory

The first mention of the SYNTH project is in [Ren's log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log), as a source of inspiration for his own work, among 
several other inventions built with the goal of helping humanity. Dallus Lauren was Ren's father, with his full name 
being Ikaro Lauren.

### The First Synth

Lab assistant [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) became terminally ill with the 'big C' or Chronic Environmental Respiratory 
System, being diagnosed in 2027. Rebecca's next appearance is in the [Tekka interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview) in 2028, 
with her now being the first human successfully transferred into a synth body. Nex Gen even encourages her to smoke as a marketing 
ploy, intending to show how indestructible the synth bodies are. The news articles tell us more 
about the synths and how they are perceived.

### Synths in the News

In the [webbrowser](webbrowser), there are some articles that tell us more about the synths. 
[Synthetic Humans](tdw-riseofsynth) is an in-universe article about how the synths work. They call the 
SYNTH project a fusion of artificial intelligence and human consciousness. The article reveals that head 
researcher Dallus was uniquely suited for the project due to his expertise in neural (brain-related) transfers and biotechnology. 
The article mentions that Rebecca quickly became a sensation due to the project.

The synths were supposed to be way to gain eternal life, intelligence and beauty. The author of the 
article delves deeper into the ethics of the project, exploring the concept of humanity itself and whether it 
is possible to preserve it in a synth body. They also point at dilemma's around identity, freedom and possible 
misuse of synths. Nex Gen Corporation is also surrounded by controversy at the time of writing, due to their forced uploads 
of the consciousness dying humans. This article does not include a date or author, but also states that synthetic humans are becoming more common. It also refers 
to Rebecca Sinclair as a "cautionary tale".

The [article about Lupamine](tdw-riseoflupamine) tells us more about the consequences of the project. While synths are thought to be immune to addiction, 
Rebecca's shining hope for humanity turns into [Lupamine](lupamine) addiction instead. It even turns out that her synth 
body amplified the effects of the drug, making her even more violent and prone to addiction. Other synths, called SIMPs (or Subservient 
Intimate Machine Partners), are used to satisfy the depravity of others. Nex Gen also develops synths as a national security 
weapon, creating a type of combat synth.
