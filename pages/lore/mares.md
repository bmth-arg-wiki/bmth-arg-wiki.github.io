# Mares

> The Mares were not mere hallucinations but shared visions that exploited the cognitive architecture of their victims,-
> -inducing paralysing fear.

Mares are nightmarish shared hallucinations, often compared to sleep paralysis demons. We seem to occasionally 
see these mares in the ARG, with several characters being confirmed to suffer from them. 

Visions of mares were also discovered in [Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren), who would draw the mares. He was not exposed 
to the cult in the same way, suggesting that he may have inherited them or that the ability was cultivated somehow. 
[Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem) speculates that the mares may have an epigenetic factor.

## Background

### Skys' Mares

Skys went through a lot of trauma as a kid, which stemmed from his unique pink hair, a consequence of nuclear fallout 
from World War 3.0. He was born in [Novosovia](novosovia), a religious country with strong government control. 
People feared the pink-haired boy, and he was kicked out by his parents at 8 years old. He fled to Ingleterra, where 
he met a group practicing the law of Velama (based on real-life Thelema), with mysterious powers. After the group leader 
Alby did terrible things to Skys, he eventually took revenge and fled again.

This time Skys ended up in an abandoned asylum, as we learn from [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2). 
The events around this time are in the music video for [Teardrops](../music/song-teardrops), which also shows Skys 
dyeing his hair black with leech blood. He ends up taking a lot of drugs, which gave him chronic sleep paralysis and 
visions of the mares.

At some point, Skys picked up a guitar and found success with his band "Skys & the Starjammers". He started appearing in 
interviews, at which point he caught the attention of scientist [Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), the founder 
of neospiritualism. 

### Cult of Mantra

Strassman decided to meet up with Skys at the [Skys & the Starjammers soirée](../for-sof/skystarjammers) at the October 
Palace. This was in 2004, after Skys had decided to return to their home country of Novosovia. He brought along 
his partner [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) and their assistant Ro. That night, Skys demonstrated 
some of his mystical powers, which impressed the scientists enough to stay with the cult.

In the year of 2015, Skys started [Project Kingslayer](incident-kingslayer). He believed others could gain access to 
the powers of the mares (and possibly enlightenment) through pain. He started torturing his patient zero, 
[Alfgram](../characters/alfgram), who boasted that the experiment had given him access to other dimensions and the power 
to harness dark matter. Skys looked for more willing subjects through an encrypted message he sent out to the youth of Novosovia. 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), prominent mob boss and company owner in the powerful [DTC](dtc) got access 
to the message, who was very interested in the applications of their research as a bioweapon.

In 2020, the Novosovian government tried to intervene in the cult at October Palace, in an event named the October Massacre. 
Notably, the cult members were able to fend off hundreds of troops by using psychological warfare: they managed to cause 
visions of the mares that would bring grown men to their knees.

### D.U.S.T. & P.S.Y.

The first document released speaking about the mares was the [Project D.U.S.T. Proposal](../for-sof/project_dust).
The document tells us Dallus is still very much suffering from mares, as well as his son [Ren](../characters/ren). 
The proposal is written in 2021, when [Lyra](../characters/lyra-lauren) was just a newborn. Ren has visions of the mares and 
drew them, which suggests that mares somehow affected him too. [Dallus' diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary), written shortly 
after the project proposal, reveals that Skys is now in a coma.

[Project D.U.S.T.](incident-dust) focuses on transcendence through pain. [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem) 
proposes a "phase 2 Altilium Chordata" tank. [Sof](../characters/sof) describes this in their [journal](../website/journal) 
as tanks that keep people breathing, while putting them through hell. His goal was to reach the hidden dimensions 
Skys and Alfgram spoke about.

It seems like many cult members gained the ability to manipulate mares 
through psychological/physical trauma as well as P.S.Y., or Psychoactive Structured Yttrium. 
The cult members were largely wiped out during the Fall of October Palace, an event depicted in the official music 
video for [Mantra](../music/amo-mantra).

The "Special Six", a set of children also managed to fight off their attackers using abilities similar to that of 
P.S.Y. (speculated to be in the [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid) music video. Dr. Elias Mortem remarks that these 
abilities are either cultivated (which means they would have been experimented on) 
or innate (they were born with them). These children were recovered during Operation Trinity and are brought to
ARC/HIVE. It seems likely that they were used as test subjects for Arc/Hive's projects, as the project proposal states 
that the subjects they are experimenting on are too dangerous to release.

Since children are now also displaying the abilities that the cult members gained through Mantra's sadistic drug-fueled 
activities, Elias speculates that there may be an epigenetic component to the mares. This implies that mares, once 
present in a parent, can be passed onto their children.

### VSPR-37

The [VSPR-37](vspr37) pandemic seems to be caused by physical manifestations of mares in the real world, also 
referred to as voidlings. They look similar to sleep paralysis demons.

During the pandemic [Selene](../characters/selene) is a young woman living in [New Elysium](new-elysium), with the same pink hair 
observed in Skys and later [Sof](../characters/sof). She is referred to as NYX-01 by Nex Gen's FANTOM team in the 
[Kingslayer Codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec). Nex Gen attempts to retrieve Selene and her friend [Scott](../characters/scott), 
who is referred to as NYX-02, but Scott has transformed into a voidling and attacks Selene. The FANTOM team brings her back 
to Nex Gen's facilities, where they discover that she is immune to the virus. 

### Post Pandemic

Selene's unique pineal gland still produces DMT and turns out to be the source of her immunity, and allows her to 
[enter Youtopia](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc) in 2038. Before entering the dimension, she must cleanse herself 
of "mare attachments" through performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP). [E.V.E.](../characters/eve) 
sees great potential in helping humanity escape to Youtopia, after the world was ruined by the war, the pandemic and 
the resulting voidlings and starts [Project Dreamseeker](dreamseeker).

The [LBR Sites letter](../for-sof/lbr_sites)proposes Nex Gen builds several facilities to perform this ritual, to help 
more people access Youtopia. The letter stresses the importance of the sites after the disasterous "Cradle Crash". 
This was an event in 2037 in the final days of Arc/Hive, before the Nex Gen re-brand. The incident was caused by 
bi-directional energies colliding, with one of those energy sources being Dallus Lauren's consciousness. 
Dallus Lauren himself is mentioned to have died around the same time in the [D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log) and 
the re-cap at the end of Sof's journal. 

Nex Gen's own Karl Strassman also manages to synthesise Selene's unique indole alkaloid structure into a drug named 
[P.U.S.S-E](pusse), which could help humanity access Youtopia. The initial results of drug trials worry Strassman, 
who contacts E.V.E. in the [Strassman Codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec). Strassman also questions her motives, but E.V.E. 
stresses that this is the only way forward and that she will continue the project.

### Chapel Incident

In 2040, [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem) and his team are slaughtered by voidlings in the 
[Chapel Incident](incident-chapel). Some footage was left behind in a [video](../for-sof/chapel) for Sof. The incident 
also happens around the time Sof themselves is born. They speculate that the deaths are the direct result of 
Project D.U.S.T. and the dark side of Youtopia.

### Sof's Youth

> Or maybe she’s the voidling that lingers by the east wing viewport, gray and night, chanting in tongues. 
> Some rancid, sour hymn from a place where the sun never shone.
> 
> Sof's journal (introduction)

In some parts of Sof's journal, they mention that they are 8-years old, dating at least part of the writing back 
to 2048. Several voidlings are still active and endangering people at this time, and one particular voidling seemingly 
keeps watching Sof.
