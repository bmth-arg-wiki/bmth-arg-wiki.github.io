# Mares

Mares are nightmarish shared hallucinations, often compared to sleep paralysis demons. We seem to occasionally 
see these mares in the ARG, with several characters being confirmed to suffer from them. 

The transferral of mares can also be genetical, as evidenced by [Lyra Lauren](../characters/lyra-lauren) inheriting 
them from her father [Dallus](../characters/dallus-lauren), despite her being born at ARC/HIVE.

## Background

We first learn about the mares in [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust), a document detailing a lot of the 
research that took place during the [ARC/HIVE](archive) era of [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation), as well as 
previous research done by the [Cult of Mantra](mantra).

The document tells us Dallus is still very much suffering from mares, as well as his youngest daughter [Lyra](../characters/lyra-lauren). 
While [Elena](../characters/elena-lauren) went into labour with her during their escape in [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document), 
she ended up being born in the safety of ARC/HIVE per [Dallus' Diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary).

[Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) speaks about the event at October Palace, at the 
[concert of Skys & the Starjammers](../for-sof/skystarjammers). At this time, leader [Skys](../characters/skys) was 
already suffering from mares from taking a lot of drugs. Here, he demonstrated some of his extraordinary abilities, which 
are left vague. This convinces [Dallus](../characters/dallus-lauren) and [Strassman](../characters/strassman) to start 
working with the cult leader.

From Project D.U.S.T.'s research proposal we also learn that the cult was able to fend off hundreds of troops by 
using "advanced psychological tactics". Some of these members may have been able to "harness dark matter", which 
seems to strongly be related to the mares. It seems like many cult members gained the ability to manipulate mares 
through psychological/physical trauma as well as P.S.Y., or Psychoactive Structured Yttrium.
