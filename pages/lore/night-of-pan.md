# Night of Pan

> "Within the system of Thelema, the Night of Pan, or N.O.X., is a mystical 
state that represents the stage of ego-death in the process of spiritual attainment." - Wikipedia

The night of Pan links back to the word `NOX` in the [capslock doc](../for-sof/capslock_doc), as well as 
character [Pan](../characters/pan). Pagan/witchcraft symbolism is used many times throughout the ARG.
