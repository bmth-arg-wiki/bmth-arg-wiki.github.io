# *The Four Insights*

> *As Above So Below*

THEINSIGHTS.DOC is a file in the [FOR SOF](../for-sof/for-sof#for-sof) folder. 
We do not know its author, but we assume that [Selene](../characters/selene) left it along with the other 
insights documents here for [Sof](../characters/sof).

***

## About

This document introduces us to the concept of the four insights, which we see all throughout the ARG. 
Importantly, it tells us we have to master these insights in order to 'save [youtopia](youtopia) and the people trapped within.'

Each insight is numbered and associated to an element, an [archangel](../characters/characters#the-archangels), 
an [omen](../characters/characters#omens), a curse, a direction, a [relic](booklet#page-023), and a symbol.

They make the most sense when read in order.

| Insight                              | Element | Archangel | Omen        | Curse | Direction | Relic                               | Symbol                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. [Connection](insight1-connection) | Air     | Raphael   | Pan         | ???   | East      | Pan's Flute                         | Triangle with a horizontal line in the middle             |
| 2. [Empathy](insight2-empathy)       | Water   | Gabriel   | Miseria     | ???   | West      | Guardian Tears                      | Upside down triangle                                      |
| 3. [Purpose](insight3-purpose)       | Fire    | Michael   | Vanth       | ???   | South     | Abramelin's Candle Of Eternal Tears | Triangle                                                  |
| 4. [Vision](insight4-vision)         | Earth   | Uriel     | The Babylon | ???   | North     | Golden Raspberry                    | Upside down triangle with a horizontal line in the middle |

While the Omens are mentioned in the files, the curses they bring are not.

## Insights spectrograms

The first hint about the four insights was found in a spectrogram of the song [YOUtopia](../music/song-youtopia).
The message is hidden at minute 3:48.

More [spectrograms](../music/spectrograms) related to each insight were found in the following songs:

>## The Four Insights
>
>I saw how the fabric of life is held together by the universal laws known as the 4 Insights.
>
>Each insight is represented by an archangel, and within each Insight exists an Omen & Curse - As Above So Below. 
for everything good, there is an evil counterpart.
>
>These insights are crucial to saving youtopia and the people trapped within. 
if you don't master these, that dark crack in the centre of your being will never be repaired.
>
>When you are ready, the insights are waiting for you to discover.

## Additional Information

The triangle icons representing the insights are used as the cardinal points on the compass of [Selene's Youtopia map](../for-sof/selenes_map).

![Compass from Selene's map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/insights/insight-directions.png)

As mentioned earlier: North is [Vision](insight4-vision), East is [Connection](insight1-connection), South is [Purpose](insight3-purpose), and West is [Empathy](insight2-empathy). 
Each insight is linked to a specific region of [Youtopia](youtopia).

The in-universe characters for the band all have an insight attached to them as you can see from their trading cards:

![Characters from the band on cards for the physical release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/band-cards.png)

- [Syko](../characters/syko) (Oli) has [Connection](insight1-connection)
- [Pickles](../characters/pickles) (Matt N.) has [Purpose](insight3-purpose)
- [Madman](../characters/madman) (Lee) has [Empathy](insight2-empathy)
- [Vegan](../characters/vegan) (Matt K.) has [Vision](insight4-vision)

## The Fifth Insight: Spirit

While it began as simple speculation, the fifth insight seems to be confirmed through [Selene's map](../for-sof/selenes_map).

![Middle of Selene's map, for the fifth insight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/insights/fifth-insight.png)

A fifth element was also referenced on Bring Me The Horizon's Instagram story:

![Instagram story about a BMTH show in Vegas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/insights/insta_las_vegas_story_fifth_element.png)

The pentagram that often occurs in the ARG also shows five elements, being: 
water, earth, fire, air, and **spirit**. 

The Dreamseeker Tour jacket Oli wore during the European leg contains several symbolic references, 
including a pentagram with the four triangles and the symbol for spirit.
