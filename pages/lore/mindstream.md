# Mindstream

Mindstream is a technology pushing the boundaries of immersive entertainment, developed by [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation). 
An article on [the Daily Whisper](../website/webbrowser) compares it to a Virtual Reality experience, 
emphasizing that this experience is even more immersive through direct communication with 
the brain.

## Backstory

Mindstream is a service offering an artificial experience. It uses advanced technology to communicate with the brain 
and sends signals directly to its visual center. This makes Mindstream experiences very life-like, something which Nex 
Gen has both been applauded and criticised for. Nex Gen's head publicly promotes it, although he has been much less 
talkative about other Nex Gen experiments.

### Mindstream's Introduction in the News

> By all accounts, Mindstream is nothing short of a revolution. [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), 
> head of NEX GEN, calls it a masterpiece in personalised entertainment, a shift that redefines storytelling itself.

The article [The Future of Entertainment in Your Mind](../website/tdw-futureentertainment) is written around the service's release, 
by an unknown author. It describes how the technology works and also addresses some of the criticism Nex Gen has received for it.

Mindstream's technology uses neural interfacing, a method of communicating with the
brain through technology. It uses so called brain-computer interfaces, non-invasive devices
that allowing Mindstream to directly tap into the brain's visual center, making experiences
life-like. The technology is also compared to being in a lucid dream "but with far more control".

Victor Carmine emphasizes its potential applications in therapy and education, since the technology is also 
memory-enhancing. At the time of writing the service is in the beta streaming phase, expected for full release 
later that year. The author remarks and that we are entering a new era of entertainment, which could lead to unexpected 
consequences.

The author delves into the critics and their concerns, with neuroscientists, ethicists and philosophers among them. 
One is mentioned later in the article, her name being Dr. Elaine Trott, but the article sadly cuts off after her introduction.
The main concern with Mindstream the direct communication of the technology with the brain, distorting the line between artificial 
experience and reality. Early testing reports indicate subjects experiencing disorientation for longs periods of time, 
as well as shadow memories. These shadow memories cause vivid fragments of scenes to replay in their mind in a manner 
similar to PTSD patients, as a consequence of the lingering neural connection created by the experience. This caused 
great concern, since Mindstream can possibly interfere with the ability of the brain to restructure itself.

One beta tester suffered severe after-effects after experiencing a horror-themed film using Mindstream. They reported 
seeing glimpses of the movie antagonist out of the corners of their eyes. This effect was labeled as a neuroecho, 
potentially caused by over-stimulating the fear centres in the brain, which Mindstream's algorithm makes use of 
to make the experience so life-like. Carmine's team insists that these effects are temporary, according to the article.

> Will Mindstream revolutionise entertainment, or are we witnessing the beginning of yet
another tech-driven psychological fallout?

Concluding the article, the author asks if Mindstream will be a passing fad. Nex Gen maintains that the technology 
can help improve mental stability and provide emotional release, but initial results show detrimental effects on the 
brain. The author then questions whether it will result in further psychological harm from technology.

### DTC's Death Row Convict on Mindstream

Gideon Mourningstone writes [Faith on the Edge](../website/tdw-faithedge) about a Mindstream experience named "Faith Over Flesh", 
in which Jonah, a death row inmate, will be crucified.

> Jonah's crucifixion promises sacrificial salvation, broadcast to your soul, letting viewers tune into his
suffering in a near-sacred sensory immersion.

Mourningstone speaks about broadcasting the suffering directly into people's souls. On the forums made for the show, the 
users speak about spiritual highs and cathartic release. The DTC's ethics board spoke out about the show, although 
the concerns are labeled as "muted", indicating that might not be enough to prevent the show from airing.

The article also delves deeper into the extremists from Mantra that formed a shadow sect, Ecliptism. A sect is different from 
a cult, since the members all join voluntarily instead of being born into the religion. Ecliptism is still very similar 
to [Mantra](mantra), holding the same beliefs about a hidden reality accessible through pain and brain manipulation. 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine) was also involved with the Mantra cult, ordering [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document) 
to extract cult leader [Skys](../characters/skys), [Dr. Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) and [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman).

Gideon speaks about the rumours going around that the airing of the experience is an experiment, with the purpose of 
gathering data on a large scale. Rumours state that Ecliptism is seeking proof of the existence of another dimension, 
one that can only be accessed while experiencing pain under specific conditions. This experience on a large scale would 
result in a lot of neural data, crucial to for Ecliptism's search for salvation.

### Skyscraper Incident

In an [article](../website/tdw-clonechaos) written by [Dr. Lee MD](../characters/lee-md), he criticizes a recent incident where 
a SYNTH caused chaos. A SYNTH actor was sent off a skyscraper, resulting in six people being taken out, according to Lee MD. 
SYNTH actors were recalled at the time of the article, with this incident likely being a contributing factor. The 
author then claims that the CEO is taking heat for "cutting corners".
