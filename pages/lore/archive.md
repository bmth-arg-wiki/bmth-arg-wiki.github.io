# ARC/HIVE

ARC/HIVE was a big company with ties to the government, focusing on the development of sustainable 
projects, although [an interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview) implies there may have been sinister 
motivations from CEO [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine). 

After an incident called the 'Cradle Crash', the company re-branded itself to [Nex Gen Corporation](nex-gen-corporation). 
This company was lead by Victor as well, before [E.V.E.](../characters/eve) takes the lead over 
the company.

Their notable scientists include [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren), [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), 
[Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) and [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem). The company name itself is a play on the 
word "archive".

ARC/HIVE studied several human subjects, including [Skys](../characters/skys), [Scott](../characters/scott), 
[Selene](../characters/selene) and the so-called "special six".

## Background

### Aliens & World War 3.0

It is unknown when the company was established, but [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine) 
became its leader after a bloody family legacy. During Cold War 2.0, Carmine used his father's connection 
to make a deal with the [Novosovians](novosovia). As a result of the deal, the DTC and Novosovia 
sent out their first messages to aliens: Slavic names, likely chosen for their deeper meanings.
In 1983, the countries received their first response, but Novosovia did not trust the faint signal. This resulted 
in World War 3.0, which Carmine fought in. He was the only one out of the Carmine family to survive the war, 
which means he inherited the entire family fortune.

### Project Kingslayer

In 2015 Carmine receives a secret message, sent out by Skys to reach the youth of Novosovia. Skys 
was recruiting for his cult, which gave Carmine the perfect opportunity to send in his own secret agent:
[Medea](../characters/medea), his very own daughter. He decides that she should try to seduce Skys to 
get access to his research. Skys falls in love with her at first sight, but to Carmine's dismay 
Medea eventually falls in love with Skys too. This causes her to cut contact with her father, and 
Carmine fails to get his hands on Mantra's Kingslayer research.

### Operation Trinity

The company was most relevant from 2020 until 2031, when the influential men behind the 
[Mantra cult](mantra) were extracted in [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document), at the orders of Carmine himself. 
This time he succeeded, extracting the men and most of their families safely.

After gaining access to the men behind the MANTRA cult, the company developed different types of 
technology, for both sustainability and national security goals. 
[Dr. Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) notably developed the MOXYPAK for the company, which helped purify 
air after the devastation of World War 3.0.

[Dallus' Diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) from 2021 provides another perspective on ARC/HIVE.
Dallus was promised safety in return for his cooperation and also speaks about his [synth](synths) 
project, something Carmine is very interested in. Another key figure in the trinity was [Skys](../characters/skys), 
the leader of the [Mantra cult](mantra) himself. However, Skys has gone into a in a coma and his body 
is now "useless", according to the diary.

[Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), a scientist with a particular interest in the spiritual side of science, 
is the last member of the Trinity now employed at ARC/HIVE. He sadly lost his wife [Ava](../characters/ava) 
and his child Angel is presumed dead.

### Project D.U.S.T.

In 2031 the research proposal for [Project D.U.S.T.](incident-dust) is declassified by Nex Gen, evidenced by the
logos on the page. From this we learn more about how Arc/Hive used Mantra's knowledge gained from 
[Project Kingslayer](incident-kingslayer), where torture was used to gain access to dark powers.

Arc/Hive was very interested in the supernatural phenomena that occurred around Mantra. 
Dr. Elias Mortem starts by talking about the Kingslayer project. Skys originally spearheaded 
this project, along with an individual whose name is redacted in that same proposal. 
From [Unbeleevable 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3) we learn that [Alfgram](../characters/alfgram) 
was patient zero for the project and later pushed Skys to push a traitor within the cult.

The proposal tells us that the cult members were seemingly able to harness dark matter, which could 
also be seen in their brain patterns. The more commonly named [mares](mares) were shared visions 
inducing fear in trained troops of soldiers, and Arc/Hive wanted to enable the DTC military to 
use these as a weapon. Mortem remarks that the results of Project Kingslayer may already have fallen 
into hands of enemies like the Eastern Citadel. 

Mortem proposes they carry out the research on a redacted word referring to a group extracted in 
Operation Trinity. He mentions that these subjects have anomalous abilities and cannot be released. 
The redacted word here may be children, referring to the "Special Six" children who used powers to get away from their 
executioners. It's been heavily theorised that these events are also what is seen in [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid)'s 
official music video.

To advance their research, he proposes a new version of their technology called an Altilium Chordata tank. 
The schematic attached in the research proposal closely matches the tank we see in [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark), 
which also showcases some of ARC/HIVE's other experiments in its official music video.

![Woman in a tank, touching the glass with her hands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/inthedark/gallery/f_altiliumchordatatank.png)

A woman in the altilium chordata tank (the glass on the top left states this). The number 2 indicates that we might be
looking at the second version of the tank, as described in the project proposal.

The Altilium Chordata tank is a stasis chamber, keeping the bodies of the subjects in a stable state where it 
can repair and regenerate cells. The tank inhibits endorphins, natural hormones that alleviate pain, lower stress, improve 
mood and well-being. Recalling Skys' research into pain, this seems to be a continuation of their goal to reach other 
dimensions and control dark matter. Sadly, a lot of the text on this page has been redacted.

### Project P.S.Y. & S.Y.K.O.

The project proposal further raises the topic of P.S.Y., or Psychoactive Structured Yttrium. This is a substance 
they are interested in due to the cult being able to fend off hundreds of troops using "advanced psychological tactics", possibly 
referring to the manipulation of mares. P.S.Y. possibly refers to the drug Mantra, that the cult was taking as evidenced 
by [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2).

The research proposal subject line also refers to Project S.Y.K.O, likely referring to the character 
[Syko](../characters/syko). More information about this project might be behind some of the redacted lines and 
potentially relates to Dallus' [synth](synths) research.

### Synth Research

Dallus Lauren was the one who initially proposed the [synth](synths) project, something Carmine was all too interested in.
[Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) was a terminally ill lab-assistant at Arc/Hive. She writes her
[Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr) in 2027, after learning she was going to die. She becomes the first 
synth, being credited as a [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) invention in an [interview with Tekka Magazine](../for-sof/tekka_interview) 
in 2028. 

{% include content/danger.html
title="Trigger Warning"
content="The Daily Whisper Articles contain some very triggering topics. We have added some extra warnings here."
%}

Initially, it seemed synths were more resistant to addiction and harmful substances. This all changed 
when Rebecca became addicted to Nex Gen's wolf tranquiliser: [lupamine](lupamine). The daily whisper news articles
[Rise of Lupamine](../website/tdw-riseoflupamine), [Clone Chaos](../website/tdw-clonechaos), 
[Rise of Synth](../website/tdw-riseofsynth), [Blood Red Spectacles](../website/tdw-bloodredspectacles), and 
[Rogue Sentinels](../website/tdw-roguesentinels) all detail various incidents, some of which are incredibly severe.

### The Cradle Crash

The Cradle Crash was the incident that marked the end of the Arc/Hive name for the company. 
Victor Carmine's [interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview) reveals that Arc/Hive was re-branded 
to Nex Gen fully just after the incident. The interview itself is also stated to take place 
a few days after the Cradle Crash, which takes place on the 25th of October 2037.

> "Arc/Hive rebranded to NEX GEN, and Dallus is *dead*, with evidence suggesting 
grim-play. EVE, an advanced research engine was activated, and VSPR-37, a virus that turned people into voidlings 
(zombie-like creatures), began spreading, all within a few days."
> - [Sof's journal](../website/journal)

The timing of this incident and the interview lines up very closely to several other events, which [Sof](../characters/sof) 
notes in the epilogue of their [journal](../website/journal).

## Other experiments

Dr. Dallus Lauren developed the MOXYPAK at ARC/HIVE, something mentioned in both his own [diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary), 
and his [son](../characters/ren)'s [log on E.V.E's genesis](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log). E.V.E. was also initially 
Dallus' project, being followed up by his son after his sudden death in October 2037. 

The MOXYPAK is also mentioned to have saved a lot of lives by [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) in her 
[November 2027 Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2). Interestingly, an unknown journalist accuses Victor Carmine of 
using Arc/Hive's seemingly well-intended inventions with malice in [a reconstructed interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview).
The device also seems present with a little girl in the music video for [Top 10 Statues](../music/song-top10).

![Printer at ARC/HIVE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/inthedark/gallery/n_printerface.png)

We also see a mysterious printer at ARC/HIVE, printing some type of data, as well as other human test subjects.
