# ARC/HIVE

ARC/HIVE was a big company with ties to the government, focusing on the development of sustainable projects. 
Their notable employees include [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren), [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), 
[Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) and [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem). 

The company later renamed itself to [Nex Gen Corporation](nex-gen-corporation) and became known for their shady experiments on humans, 
while still under the leadership of [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine). The company name is also a play on 
the word 'archive'.

ARC/HIVE also studied several human subjects, including [Skys](../characters/skys), [Scott](../characters/scott), 
[Selene](../characters/selene) and the so-called "special six".

## Background

The company was most relevant from 2020 until 2031, when the influential men behind the [Mantra cult](mantra) were extracted 
in [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document). Powerful men like [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine) 
were interested in the supernatural phenomena that seemed to occur around this cult. The company developed different 
types of technology, also being tied to some developments in the interest of national security. 
[Dr. Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) also developed the MOXYPAK for the company, which helped purify 
air in a devastated [country](dtc).

[Dallus' Diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) from 2021 gives another view on ARC/HIVE.
He was promised safety in return for his cooperation and also speaks about his [synth](synths) 
project, something Carmine is very interested in. Another key figure in the trinity was [Skys](../characters/skys), 
the leader of the [Mantra cult](mantra) himself. However, Skys has gone into a in a coma and his body is now "useless", 
according to the diary.

[Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), a scientist with a particular interest in the spiritual side of science, 
is the last member of the Trinity now employed at ARC/HIVE.

In 2031 the research proposal for [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) is declassified by Nex Gen, evidenced by the 
logos on the page. At this point, they seem to mostly have distanced themselves from the previous company name.

We learn more about the company's experiments around the time of Project D.U.S.T. from the proposal. They were 
interested in the supernatural phenomena that occurred around Mantra. Dr. Elias Mortem starts by talking about the 
Kingslayer project, something [Sof](../characters/sof) files under "incidents" in her journal. Skys originally spearheaded 
this project, along with an individual whose name is redacted in that same proposal. The proposal tells us that the cult 
members were seemingly able to harness dark matter, which could also be seen in their brain patterns. The more commonly 
named [mares](mares) were shared visions inducing fear in trained troops of soldiers.

Skys thought that psychological and/or physical distress could help subjects access hidden dimensions 
(like [Youtopia](youtopia)) and harness dark matters themselves.

Project D.U.S.T. is a direct continuation of this research. Mortem remarks that the results of this project may have fallen 
into hands of enemies like the Eastern Citadel. The primary goal of the research was to create a potent 
bioweapon, for national security purposes. Mortem proposes they carry out the research on a 
redacted word referring to a group extracted in Operation Trinity. He mentions that these subjects
have anomalous abilities and cannot be released. 
The redacted word here may be children, referring to the "Special Six" children who used powers to get away from their 
executioners. It's been heavily theorised that these events are also what is seen in [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid)'s 
official music video.

To advance their research, he proposes a new version of their technology called an Altilium Chordata tank. 
The schematic attached in the research proposal closely matches the tank we see in [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark), 
which also showcases some of ARC/HIVE's other experiments in its official music video.

A woman in the altilium chordata tank (the glass on the top left states this). The number 2 indicates that we might be
looking at the second version of the tank, as described in the project proposal.

The Altilium Chordata tank is a stasis chamber, keeping the bodies of the subjects in a stable state where it 
can repair and regenerate cells. The tank inhibits endorphins, natural hormones that alleviate pain, lower stress, improve 
mood and well-being. Recalling Skys' research into pain, this seems to be a continuation of their goal to reach other 
dimensions and control dark matter. Sadly, a lot of the text on this page has been redacted.

The project proposal further raises the topic of P.S.Y., or Psychoactive Structured Yttrium. This is a substance 
they are interested in due to the cult being able to fend off hundreds of troops using "advanced psychological tactics", possibly 
referring to the manipulation of mares. P.S.Y. possibly refers to the drug Mantra, that the cult was taking as evidenced 
by [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2).

The research proposal subject line also refers to Project S.Y.K.O, likely referring to the character 
[Syko](../characters/syko). More information about this project might be behind some of the redacted lines and 
potentially relates to Dallus' synth research, as the band are also depicted in a synth-like fashion in 
[Top 10 Statues](../music/song-top10).

## Other experiments

Dr. Dallus Lauren developed the MOXYPAK at ARC/HIVE, something mentioned in both his own [diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary), 
and his [son](../characters/ren)'s [log on Eve's genesis](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log). It is also mentioned to have saved 
a lot of lives by [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) in her [2036 Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2). 
This device also seems present with a little girl in the music video for [Top 10 Statues](../music/song-top10).

We also see a mysterious printer at ARC/HIVE, printing some type of data.
