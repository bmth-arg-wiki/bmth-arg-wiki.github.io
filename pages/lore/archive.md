# ARC/HIVE

ARC/HIVE was a big company with ties to the government, focusing on the development of sustainable projects. 
Their notable employees include [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren), [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), 
[Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) and [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem). The company later renamed 
itself to [Nex Gen Corporation](nex-gen-corporation) and became known for their shady experiments on humans, 
while still under the leadership of [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine).

ARC/HIVE also studied several human subjects, including [Skys](../characters/skys), [Scott](../characters/scott), 
[Selene](../characters/selene) and the so-called "special six".

## Background

![ARC/HIVE logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/inthedark/gallery/c_neurologo.png)

The logo for ARC/HIVE, as seen in the video [In The Dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) and 
later used for the password screen for the [Tekka Interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview), 
with [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca), the first synth and one of their employees.

ARC/HIVE is an organisation that develops technology. They played a role in [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document) 
to get access to [Strassman](../characters/strassman), [Skys](../characters/skys) and 
[Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren). This document also helped link the character Dallus Lauren to the "In The Dark" 
music video, which takes place at ARC/HIVE. The company name is also a play on the word 'archive'.

We learn more about the company's experiments in the [Project D.U.S.T. Research Proposal](../for-sof/project_dust). 
The proposal dates back to 2021, but was only declassified exactly 10 years later the same company, then known as 
[Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation). [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters#dr-elias-mortem) submitted the proposal as ARC/HIVE's 
head of R&D (Research & Development). This proposal would later seem to 

The research proposal also refers to Project S.Y.K.O, likely referring to the character 
[Syko](../characters/syko).

## Experiments

A woman in the altilium chordata tank (the glass on the top left states this). The number 2 indicates that we might be 
looking at the second version of the tank, mentioned in [Project D.U.S.T](../for-sof/project_dust).

![Printer at ARC/HIVE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/inthedark/gallery/n_printerface.png)

We also see a mysterious printer at ARC/HIVE, printing some type of data directly onto 
a long roll of (presumably) paper.
