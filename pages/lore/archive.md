# ARC/HIVE

ARC/HIVE was a big company with ties to the government, focusing on the development of sustainable projects. 
Their notable employees include [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren), [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman), 
[Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) and [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem). The company later renamed 
itself to [Nex Gen Corporation](nex-gen-corporation) and became known for their shady experiments on humans, 
while still under the leadership of [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine). The company name is also a play on 
the word 'archive'.

ARC/HIVE also studied several human subjects, including [Skys](../characters/skys), [Scott](../characters/scott), 
[Selene](../characters/selene) and the so-called "special six".

## Background

The company was most relevant from 2020 until 2031, when the influential men behind the [Mantra cult](mantra) were extracted in 
[Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document). They were interested in the supernatural phenomena that seemed to occur 
around this cult and its leader [Skys](../characters/skys). However, Skys is in a coma and his body "useless", according to 
[Dallus' Diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary).

ARC/HIVE is an organisation that develops technology, with strong government ties. Their boss [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine)
ordered Operation Trinity to get access to [Strassman](../characters/strassman), [Skys](../characters/skys) and
[Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren).

In 2031 the research proposal for [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) is declassified by Nex Gen, evidenced by the 
logos on the page. This means that at this point they were actively working on their re-brand under the new company name.

We learn more about the company's experiments around the time of Project D.U.S.T. from the proposal. They were 
interested in the supernatural phenomena that occurred around Mantra. Dr. Elias Mortem starts by talking about the Kingslayer 
project, something [Sof](../characters/sof) files under "incidents" in her journal. From Sof we also learn that 
the project involved the [Cult of Mantra](mantra). The proposal tells us that Skys was able to harness dark matter, seemingly 
being able to control a physical manifestation of his [mares](mares). Skys believed that psychological and/or physical distress 
could help subjects access hidden dimensions (like [Youtopia](youtopia)) and harness dark matters themselves. 
From [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) it also becomes clear that Strassman initially sought contact with Skys, 
pointing to him being the redacted name concerned with Project Kingslayer.

Project D.U.S.T. is a direct continuation of this research. Mortem remarks that the results of this project may have fallen 
into hands of enemies like the Eastern Citadel. The primary objective of the research was to create a potent 
bioweapon, for national security purposes. Mortem proposes they carry out the research on a 
redacted word referring to a group extracted in Operation Trinity. He mentions that these subjects
have anomalous abilities and can not be released. 
The redacted word here may be children, referring to the "Special Six" children who used powers to get away from their 
executioners. It's been heavily theorized that these events are also what is seen in [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid)'s 
official music video.

To advance their research, he proposes a new version of something called an Altilium Chordata tank. 
We likely see this tank in "in the dark"'s official music video. The picture attached in the research proposal also looks like 
this.

A woman in the altilium chordata tank (the glass on the top left states this). The number 2 indicates that we might be
looking at the second version of the tank).

The Altilium Chordata tank is a stasis chamber, keeping the bodies of the subjects in a stable state where it 
can repair and regenerate cells. The tank inhibits endorphins, natural hormones that alleviate pain, lower stress, improve 
mood and well-being. Recalling Skys research into pain, this seems to be a continuation of their goal to reach ascension 
and control over dark matter. Sadly, a lot of the text about the tank has been redacted.

The project proposal further raises the topic of P.S.Y., or Psychoactive Structured Yttrium. This is a substance 
they are interested in due to the cult being able to fend off hundreds of troops using "advanced psychological tactics", possibly 
referring to the manipulation of mares. P.S.Y. possibly refers to the drug Mantra, that the cult was taking as evidenced 
by [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2).

The research proposal subject line also refers to Project S.Y.K.O, likely referring to the character 
[Syko](../characters/syko). More information about this project might be behind some of the redacted lines.

## Other experiments

We also see a mysterious printer at ARC/HIVE, printing some type of data directly onto 
a long roll of (presumably) paper.
