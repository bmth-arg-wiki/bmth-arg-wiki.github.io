# ARC/HIVE

![ARC/HIVE logo](../../Resources/music/inthedark/gallery/c_neurologo.png)

The logo for ARC/HIVE, as seen in the video [In The Dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) and 
later used for the password screen for the [Tekka Interview](../files/tekka_interview), 
with [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca), the first synth.
Rebecca was a terminally ill lab assistant at the company, suffering from CERS (Chronic Environmental Respiratory Syndrome).

ARC/HIVE is an organisation that develops technology. They played a role in [Operation Trinity](../files/trinity_document) 
to get access to [Strassman](../characters/strassman), [Skys](../characters/skys) and 
[Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren).
This document also helped link the character Dallus Lauren to the "In The Dark" music video,
which takes place at ARC/HIVE.
The company name is also a play on the word 'archive'.

We learn more about the company's experiments in the [Project D.U.S.T. Research Proposal](../files/project_dust). 
The proposal dates back to 2021, but was only declassified exactly 10 years later by [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation).
[Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/characters#dr-elias-mortem) submitted the proposal as ARC/HIVE's head of R&D
(Research & Development). The research proposal also refers to Project S.Y.K.O, likely referring to the character 
[Syko](../characters/syko).

## Experiments

![Woman in a tank, touching the glass with her hands](../../Resources/music/inthedark/gallery/f_altiliumchordatatank.png)

A woman in the altilium chordata tank (the glass on the top left states this). The number 2 indicates that we might be 
looking at the second version of the tank, mentioned in [Project D.U.S.T](../files/project_dust).

![Printer at ARC/HIVE](../../Resources/music/inthedark/gallery/n_printerface.png)

We also see a mysterious printer at ARC/HIVE, printing some type of data directly onto 
a long roll of (presumably) paper.
