# Chapel Incident

The Chapel Incident occurred in February 2040, according to [Sof's journal](../website/journal), close or on 
their own birthday (February 25th). The passage in the journal is written about the [chapel video](../for-sof/chapel). 
The incident is most infamous for leading to the death of [Arc/Hive](archive) and [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) 
researcher [Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem) and his team.

## Background

Very little is known about the Chapel Incident, beyond what Sof speculates in her journal. Sof observes that 
the creatures are [mares](mares) in a physical form, now being able to physically hurt their targets. They 
speculate that this is the result of [Project D.U.S.T.](incident-dust) and/or the twisted side of [Youtopia](youtopia). 
They also mysteriously write that the basement is "calling" them, curious about what is hidden down there.
