Youtopia is a fictional universe that can be entered using [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse).

![YOUTOPIA: Step out of the coma](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/socials/promotional_image_pusse_youtopia.png)

Selene also created a [map](../for-sof/selenes_map) of Youtopia and we created an [interactive version](../map) you 
can use to travel around the related pages, which will tell you more about (mainly) the inhabitants of the mysterious 
dimension also known as Y-93.

## Backstory

Youtopia was supposed to provide a pleasant experience to patients from [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation), away from a world 
devastated by war and the [VSPR-37 pandemic](vspr37).

The goal of reaching hidden dimensions had been a goal of Nex Gen (then known as [ARC/HIVE](archive)) since 2021 with 
[Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust). The first steps into this hidden dimension also named Y-93, were documented 
by Nex Gen with their test subject [Selene](../characters/selene).
A [document only distributed at the pop-up shops](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc) emphasized the role of the Lesser Banishing 
Ritual of the Pentagram in the process of reaching Youtopia, although the need for this was later replaced by the Dreamseeker tanks.

Selene was found to be a particularly interesting subject after being bitten by [Scott](../characters/scott) during the 
VSPR-37 outbreak in 2037. She turned out to be immune to the virus, which was apparently due to her special pineal gland. 
The [Dreadit post](../for-sof/dreadit) dives deeper into how most people do not naturally produce DMT anymore, making the 
large amount Selene produces even more special. 
[Strassman](../characters/strassman) and [E.V.E.](../characters/eve) discuss the synthesization of Selene's unique 
biological structures into a drug called [P.U.S.S-E](pusse) in the [Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec). However, 
Dr. Strassman has found that P.U.S.S-E causes dangerous side effects to their subjects. E.V.E. reiterates that Youtopia 
should be invoked and that humanity needs this. She is willing to sacrifice a few and reasons that it will be for the 
greater good, although Strassman doubts her motives and accuses her of using their subjects as batteries, since her need 
for power is increasing.

Much of the website messages refer to some kind of corruption of Youtopia, although we have not learned much more about it.
