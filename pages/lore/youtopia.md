# Youtopia (place)

> You can find the article about the song YOUtopia [here](../music/song-youtopia).

Youtopia is a fictional universe that can be entered using [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse).

It is supposed to provide a pleasant experience to patients, but P.U.S.S-E causes distressing 
side effects to the participants. E.V.E. states that Youtopia will liberate humanity and that

suffering of the patients is necessary for the greater good.
