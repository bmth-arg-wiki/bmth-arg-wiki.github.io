Youtopia is a fictional universe that can be entered using [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse).

It is supposed to provide a pleasant experience to patients, but P.U.S.S-E causes distressing 
side effects to the participants. E.V.E. states that Youtopia will liberate humanity and that 
humanity needs this in a video from the [FOR SOF](../files/for-sof) folder, even remarking that the 
suffering of the patients is necessary for the greater good.
