> A very small percentage of individuals may experience delusions when exposed to certain frequencies. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a television or screen or while playing video games, including games played on the DREAMSEEKER© console, may induce headbanging in these individuals. Certain conditions may induce previously undetected symptoms even in persons who have no history of prior delusions. If you, or anyone in your family, has this condition, consult your physician prior to playing. If you experience any of the following symptoms while playing this product – dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or possession – IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming play.
>DREAMSEEKER© is a getaway to realms of endless adventure and boundless imagination, but its power comes with inherent risks. Before delving into its immersive experiences, it is imperative to exercise caution and prioritise self-care. Prologued use may lead to fatigue, eye strain, or discomfort. Remember to take regular breaks, stay hydrated, and maintain proper posture while gaming.  Additionally, be mindful of your surroundings and ensure adequate lighting to prevent accidents or injury. DREAMSEEKER© offers unparalleled escapades, but your well-being is paramount. Play responsibly and enjoy the journey safely.
