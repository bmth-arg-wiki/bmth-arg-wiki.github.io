# Ecliptism

Ecliptism is a shadowy sect, formed from Mantra cult extremists. They believe that pain can be 
used to purify the soul and that there is a hidden dimension, accessible under specific conditions. 

The [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse) contains knowledge about the Eclipse, an event that 
seems to be similar to personal salvation. The religion of those writing the book of Eclipse has likely 
inspired these modern Ecliptists in the [DTC](dtc), where [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) is established.
