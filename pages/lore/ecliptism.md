# Ecliptism

> Alfgram taught, "Pain is the key, and suffering the vessel. Let each wound be a mark upon the soul, a passage 
> into the unknown. For only the wounded see beyond".

Ecliptism is a shadowy sect, formed from Mantra cult extremists. They believe that pain can be 
used to purify the soul and that there is a hidden dimension, accessible under specific conditions. 

The [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse) contains knowledge about the Eclipse, an event that 
seems to be similar to personal salvation. The religion of those writing the book of Eclipse has likely 
inspired these modern Ecliptists in the [DTC](dtc), where [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) is established.

## Backstory

It is unknown where Ecliptism originated, but the earliest mention in the timeline is [Skys](../characters/skys) 
meeting with Alfgram. In the [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse), the story of Alfgram and Skys is explained, 
as well as some of the core practices of the religion. 

In the book, we learn that Alfgram and Skys were at October Palace together. [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) 
informs us that Skys returned with his band to Novosovia in 2004, meaning that the events at October 
Palace in this book probably also took place at this time. 

On the 19th of December 2004 Skys hosts an event at October Palace, which seems to signify 
the start of the [Mantra cult](mantra). With Skys now leading his own cult and Alfgram dead, 
Ecliptism disappears for a while.

It seemingly re-surfaces in the [DTC](dtc), where modern Ecliptists use technology including 
[Mindstream](mindstream). In the article on Mindstream's [Faith Over Flesh](tdw-faithedge), 
modern Ecliptists still use suffering and mind manipulation to attempt to access the hidden dimension.

### Core Beliefs

We will refer to the writers of this book as the original Ecliptists, since no official name has been provided.
In the Book of Eclipse, Alfgram and his followers meet a young Skys, right around the time he would 
form [Skys & the Starjammers](../for-sof/skystarjammers). 

The original ecliptists seem to follow a deity called the "Veiled Goddess", with passage I being 
dedicated to her. She is also called the "Belmic Mother" and "She-Who-Guards". The followers 
bring her offerings in the form of suffering.

> “Only through the eclipse can the true spirit emerge, raw and unadorned, stripped of illusion.”

The followers believe in something called "the Eclipse", which will bring out one's true spirit. 
Spirit has also been confirmed to be the [fifth insight](insights) through Oli's Dreamseeker costume.

The Ecliptists used the Seven Trials of Purity to reach the Eclipse. Currently, not all of them are known. The order of
the first three trials is:

1. Silence
2. Blood
3. Hunger

The Book of Eclipse also mentions that the rituals grow darker in nature. The trials of Darkness and
Fire also exist, but it is unclear where in the order they appear. Passage IV is also called
"The Trial of Suffering". They also believed the world would end in an event called the "Eternal Shadow", 
leaving only those who "bear the mark".

### Skys & Alfgram

> “Skys, you have strayed from the path. You seek mastery, but mastery is illusion, a chain binding the spirit.”

Passage VI contains the first mention of trouble between Alfgram and Skys. A later passage states that 
Alfgram sees pride in Skys, something he believes will prevent him for ascending. Alfgram confronts Skys, 
but Skys disagrees, prompting Alfgram and his most loyal followers to leave October Palace. These followers call him 
the "First Shadow", or "Shepherd of Suffering", for seeing through Skys' intentions.

Skys awoke the next morning, furious to find them gone and ordering the remaining followers to hunt 
them down. Alfgram had visions of Skys while hiding with his followers, that told him Skys would not 
stop until they were dead. Eventually they confront each other. Skys gives Alfgram a chance to 
surrender to him, which Alfgram refuses and he ends up being killed by Skys.

> And with his last breath, Alfgram spoke, “In suffering, I am free; in shadow, I find light. Seek the darkness, 
> for it is the face of all truth.” And thus did Alfgram ascend beyond flesh, his spirit a beacon to faithful.

Alfgram claimed to be set free, with his followers believing that their leader had ascended and become the 
First Eclipse. The followers had believed that Skys would bear what they called "the true path", but the 
Book of Eclipse states that Alfgram ended up following this path instead.

### Modern Ecliptism

Modern Ecliptism seems to re-surface at the same time Nex Gen's [SYNTH](synths) project is going 
sour, with synths succumbing to [lupamine addiction](lupamine). The first synth was created in 2028, 
placing the modern Ecliptism somewhere after this year, since the Daily Whisper articles seem to be released 
around the same time and link to each other.

In [Faith Over Flesh](tdw-faithedge), described in an article on [The Daily Whisper](webbrowser), a death-row inmate 
named Jonah will be crucified in an immersive artificial experience. The man had recently found new faith and 
is rumoured to be involved with Ecliptism, something the author links back to the [Mantra cult](mantra). Since 
the technology communicates directly with the brain, this show has the potential for modern Ecliptists to 
use it for their own beliefs. Believing that brain manipulation and suffering purify the soul, they may have 
been using the show to reach their own Eclipse. 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine) promotes both [Mindstream](mindstream) and the show itself, stating that 
the technology has many beneficial applications, despite critics pointing out many concerning possibilities and test 
anomalies.
