## NEX GEN study

The following segment was transcribed from the [Genesis storyline](genesis-storyline) Oli posted on Instagram:

> *"NEX GEN was a scientific study, researching the next step in the evolution of the human race. 
It emplored people to come forward to help unlock the mysteries of evolution. The scientists 
built a stae of the art advanced A.I research engine named [E.V.E](../characters/eve) designed to conduct mass 
experiments on humans and use deep learning to rapidly progress research. After NEX GEN went 
wrong and produced mutations the scientists abandonded the project and attempted to shut down E.V.E."*
