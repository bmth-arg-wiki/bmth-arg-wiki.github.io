Nex Gen is a company that was previously known as [ARC/HIVE](archive). The company does research into spirituality, 
consciousness, hidden dimensions, dark matter and cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence, making their research inherently dangerous.

The company is lead by [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), the mysterious man behind [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document), 
[Project D.U.S.T./S.Y.K.O.](../for-sof/project_dust), the test subjects from the [Kingslayer Codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec) 
and likely many more experiments. They also hold information about mysterious [Goxmog](../for-sof/goxmog) sightings.

Project D.U.S.T. was a continuation of Project Kingslayer from the cult of Mantra around 2021, when the company was still 
called ARC/HIVE. It continues with the research of the trinity, who were extracted by them around Christmas 2020 in Operation Trinity. 
This project proposal also focuses on the development of a tank to keep subjects in stasis, something that seems very similar 
to the Dreamseeker tanks we see Nex Gen develop later.

### Rebecca & Synths

In early 2027, [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) posts about being diagnosed with Chronic Environmental Respiratory Syndrome (C.E.R.S.) on 
[Grumblr](../for-sof/grumblr). At the time, she is still a lab assistant at ARC/HIVE and terminally ill. 
Not much later in June 2028, an interview from Tekka with interviewer Jax Jackson reveals that she is now a synth, 
a project [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) worked on for ARC/HIVE and Nex Gen. Her synth body is 
credited to Nex Gen. She has also been promoted to managing the R&D team. In the interview she is also asked about 
Victor, Dallus and Strassman, questions Rebecca does not wish to answer.

In the [second Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2) we get from Rebecca in November 2036, she is working with Dallus and 
Strassman for the first time on the [SYNTH](synths) project. Strassman tells her that [Skys](../characters/skys) is not coming back 
in any natural way, so they upload his consciousness into a synth body. He immediately starts begging for death and 
Dallus and Strassman end up arguing about what put him into this state. Rebecca ends her recount of the events with the words 
"I'll do it", likely referring to the disposal of Skys, leaving his final fate unknown at the moment.
While Rebecca is meant to be a beacon of hope for humanity, she later falls victim to one of Nex Gen's drugs, [Lupamine](lupamine), 
which her synth body has made her more susceptible to. From the [webbrowser](webbrowser) we also learn more about the 
truth behind the SYNTH project.

### Ren & E.V.E.

[Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren), Dallus' son, was also employed at Nex Gen and played a significant role in their 
developments. He created at least three AI assistants in the RO8OT line, being [D8](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log), [R8](../for-sof/r8) 
and [M8](../m8). The intention was to eventually create 8 of these robots, as is revealed in Dallus' [diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary). 
D8 was first in operation on the day that Ikaro (nicknamed Ren) activated [E.V.E.](../characters/eve), an AI that will 
seemingly do anything to suit her own interests. R8 followed shortly thereafter, with the ability to reconstruct the past. 
M8 is a multidimensional navigator, meaning she can explore multiple dimensions. M8 is created before [Sof](../characters/sof) 
is born.

### The pandemic

In the year 2037 there is an outbreak of the [VSPR-37 pandemic](vspr37). Nex Gen's secret team of operatives, FANTOM, 
attempts to retrieve test subjects NYX-01 (Selene) and NYX-02 ([Scott](../characters/scott)). Scott, already suffering 
greatly from the virus, bites Selene and is shot by operative Spectre or his team. Scott does not survive the encounter.

Selene, while bitten, seems to be immune to the virus, making her a vital piece of the puzzle to find the cure for the 
pandemic. Nex Gen is particularly interested in her pineal gland, that produces significantly more natural DMT. 
Nex Gen discovers that she can enter [Youtopia](youtopia), something we learn more about in the [document distributed 
physically at the pop-up shops](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc). This also details the importance of performing the 
Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) before entering the dimension, also labeled Y-93.

### LBR sites

On an unknown date in 2038, the [LBR sites letter](../for-sof/lbr_sites) was sent from Strassman and a redacted name 
to Carmine and another redacted name. Strassman speaks about establishing two new Lesser Banishing Ritual Sites, above two eldritch conduits in 
Heian-Kyna and Kaniwa-kyna. These sites are positioned above powerful energy sources, crucial to the functioning of the sites. 
We learn that something catastrophic happened during the final days the company was named ARC/HIVE, where an incident 
happened because of a surge of aetheric hyperflux colliding with Dallus' consciousness. Several modifications have been 
made to their systems to keep what is called the Astral Matrix stable. 
These sites are constructed to perform the LBRP on a larger scale and help people reach Youtopia, likely as a direct 
consequence of what they learned in their research with Selene. Strassman also remarks that there are four ruins hidden 
in laboratories that Nex Gen is searching for, which is also underlined in the letter.

### P.U.S.S.-E

In June 2039, the [Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec) is recorded. In it, we hear a conversation between Karl Strassman 
and E.V.E. Strassman informs her that they have been able to synthesize Selene's unique indole alkaloid structure
(from her special pineal gland) into a drug, called pineal upregulation synthetic substance or [P.U.S.S-E](pusse) for short. 
Sadly, the drug has had devastating consequences on its subjects' mind. Many of them have suffered organ failure or 
other systemic failure, indicating that many of them are dying.
Despite the side effects, E.V.E. insists that they continue with their plan to invoke Youtopia. Strassman wonders about 
her motivations, since her energy needs are increasing and she seems to be using humans as batteries to her own benefit.

### Unbeleevable

Somewhere in the year 2039, the [first episode of Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable) is also released. Along with the episode itself, 
Selene also left a letter sent by Nex Gen's PR department. The letter is from a woman named Susan White, addressed to 
a mysterious Dr. R Fletcher. She informs Fletcher of a potentially critical situation, which is the release of 
[Dr. Lee MD](../characters/lee-md)'s show Unbeleevable, broadcast on the Community Resource Analog Programming (CRAP) 
network. He has made, according to her, several accurate claims about their operations and might have access to insider 
information. She suggest a few measures: she requests they monitor the show and conduct an internal review among their 
employees, to identify any possible information sources. She also proposes a PR contingency strategy and finally, that 
they brief their FANTOM unit, in case they need to be ready for a "slate wipe", suggesting Nex Gen will go to 
extreme lengths to protect their reputation.

### Chapel Incident

Tragedy strikes for Nex Gen in 2040, when the Chapel incident occurs and Dr. Elias Mortem and his team lose their lives. 
According to Sof's journal, this may have been a direct consequence of what they started with Project D.U.S.T. 

### Sof

It also seems like Selene has turned against the company [when she gives birth to Sof in 2040](../for-sof/msgforsof). 
Sof is born inside Nex Gen's lab and the [booklet](booklet) mentions that they are actually a demi-god.
Just 20 minutes after her birth, Selene leaves Sof in the care of AI assistant M8. She leaves after hearing an alarm, remarking that this is her cue and 
she must leave. Sof then writes her journal 8 years after the chapel incident in 2048.

### Dreadit & Spiritual Research

A [Dreadit](../for-sof/dreadit) post marked 2052 (we are not sure why this date seems to be in the future) expands on Nex Gen's shady operations 
around the time of the pandemic. The user speaks about Nex Gen having immune child Selene in their facilities and that 
they have many so-called GAIA Rehab Centers all over the world. While most people have lost the ability to produce DMT 
according to the post, Selene seems to produce lots of it. Continuing the post, the user speaks about Nex Gen's mysterious 
Dreamseeker tanks, which apparently have the ability to replace the need for the LBRP when coupled with a high dose of DMT. 

The combination of the Dreamseeker tanks and P.U.S.S-E seems to be the latest version of their attempts to contact 
other dimensions and combine neuroscience and spirituality, the latter of which is also hinted at in the 
[Science Study newspaper](../for-sof/thesciencestudy). Sof also wonders in her journal if Skys' pink hair has anything 
to do with her mother or themselves.
