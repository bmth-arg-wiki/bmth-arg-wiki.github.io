Lupamine is a drug developed by [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation), that [Rebecca](../characters/rebecca) 
famously became addicted to despite being a [synth](synths).

## Backstory

Lupamine is a controversial tranquilizer created by Nex Gen to genetically resurrect their 
Lycans for the military. The article on [Jayven Valex](../website/tdw-valexlastwords) describes it as "Nex Gen's military 
dyrewolf tranquilizer". The dangerous drug brings users into a feral dissociative state, where they feel like 
they are part of a predatory nightmare.

### Lupamine Article

Rebecca Sinclair, the world's first synthetic human, was notably the first to fall victim to this. 
The [article on Lupamine](../website/tdw-loophole) provides us with an insight into the addictive substance known 
as Lupamine. The drug is also discussed in [The Rise of Lupamine](../website/tdw-riseoflupamine).

While she was supposed to be a symbol for humanity's future, previously suffering from a deadly 
disease named CERS, she became the most infamous case of Lupamine addiction. This also seems to be 
a direct consequence of her synth body amplifying its effects, despite synths previously 
being assumed to be immune to addiction.

The drug was first developed to control Nex Gen's Lycans, but became a recreational drug on the street. 
It can be inhaled or injected, often with the goal of dissociative trips and the experience of increased 
strength. These effects can then result in the violent tendencies and long-term users also experience 
memory loss, aggression, paranoia and flashbacks.
Lupamine is very addictive, with the drug leaving people desperate for more and trapped in what is also 
called a semi-loop-hole state: their minds become trapped in a circle of fear and hunting.

The DTC, or Disunited Territories of Columbia, had an epidemic of Lupamine addiction and banned it 
for public use, as a class A controlled substance. Due to the black market trade and despite warnings, 
Lupamine use was skyrocketing at the time of writing the article in the [browser](../website/webbrowser). 

### Jayven Valex's Last Words

title="Little info available"
content="Currently, there is little information available about these characters."

Another [article](../website/tdw-valexlastwords) details the death by overdose of Jayven Valex, the rising star of 
DRIVD IT. The actor was found unresponsive in his home, having used his last words to ask his assistant, 
Clara Hynes, to administer the drug to him. Authorities responded by arresting five suspects, including 
Dr. Marion Vale, Erik Cruz and Jasmine Lorran. The latter is also referred to as "Lupamine Queen". 
Dr. Vale has pled guilty to conspiracy and is awaiting a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
The article also mentions allegations of a man named Dr. Sal Marquez and Lorran exploiting 
Valex for profit.

### The Dark Rise of Lupamine

[One of the articles](../website/tdw-riseoflupamine) on the Daily Whisper about Lupamine can not be accessed due to several viruses, 
something that does not seem to be an issue on any other page.

### Unbeleevable 2: Lee Tries Lupamine

[Dr. Lee MD](../characters/lee-md) is the first one to mention Lupamine in the real timeline, 
in his show [Unbeleevable (Episode 2)](../for-sof/unbeleevable2), he even gives the 
drug a try himself. We do not learn how this ends.
