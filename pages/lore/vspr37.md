# VSPR-37

VSPR-37 is the fictional virus that notably turns [Scott](../characters/scott) into a voidling.

## Backstory

![Sof on VSPR-37](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/vspr37/vspr_sof_journal.png)

It is unknown where the virus originated from, although [Sof](../characters/sof) remarks in her [journal](journal) that 
it did happen suspiciously close to the Nex Gen facility.

Most of what we learn about the virus is from [Scott's diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal), where he 
recalls being bitten on the 28th and is slowly succumbing to the virus, with his mind deteriorating. 
All he can think about is [Selene](../characters/selene), who mentions in [her own diary](../for-sof/selene_personal_journal) 
that she misses him at school and wants to visit his house.

We learn that this meeting ends dramatically from the [Kingslayer codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec). The FANTOM team, 
a secretive internal division of [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation), refers to the two as NYX-01 (Selene) and NYX-02 (Scott). 
The call between operatives Spectre and Overwatch starts with Overwatch tracking Selene. Overwatch is also able to 
pull up visuals on Scott, where it becomes clear to them how much his mind has suffered. Selene enters his house, prompting 
the FANTOM team including Spectre to break into the house. He informs Overwatch that Scott has been terminated.

From Sof's journal we also learn that the virus transformed Scott into a voidling and that much of the world ended up infected. 
She mentions that Nex Gen used her mother to make a drug to cure the virus, that ended up "voiding" nearly everyone who took it.
