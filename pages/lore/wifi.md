# Wifi

The Multidimensional Navigator 8 has a wifi feature, which was unusable until September 30th. 

It is found in this little tab on the left:

Clicking it reveals three networks, each protected by a different password.

On the 27th and 28th of September, the pop-up stores each had a phone displaying one of the characters for one of the passwords.
Here's the Amsterdam phone as an example:

We finally got all the characters on the 30th, which lead us to unlock the first wifi network: nxEcoSubLevel.

Once connected to the wifi, an update screen appears and M8 starts talking excitedly.

Connecting to this network also makes the [Spyder browser](webbrowser) homepage change, which you can read about [here](webbrowser#Version-3).
