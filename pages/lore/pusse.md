P.U.S.S-E is short for Pineal Upregulation Synthetic Substance Enhanced, 
as seen in promotional posts. It is based on DMT, as confirmed in the [song](../music/song-pusse).

***

## Background

P.U.S.S-E is a drug, as seen in Instagram posts and implied by a pill bottle at the end of the spectrogram in 
[the song](../music/song-pusse) and additional promotional information. The stylization of puss-e (like P.u.s.s-e) is 
different between the tracklist and the instagram.

In the [Strassman Codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec) from June 2039 we learn that the pineal upregulation synthetic substance
(enhanced) is synthesized using [Selene](../characters/selene)'s exceptional pineal gland. Her unique indole alkaloid structure 
is what the substance is based on. By pairing this drug with [Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation)'s Dreamseeker tanks, subjects 
are given a chance at reaching Youtopia, however the consequences of that pursuit can be severe, likely even deadly.

Promotional post from the BMTH instagram, see page on [social posts](../socials)

The small text on the access card on the main ARG page also recommends two doses 
of P.U.S.S-E a day for this patient.
