# Church of Genesis/Genxsis

The Church of Genxsis is a religious organization that likely has 
involvement with [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).

***

## Backstory

From the [Genesis storyline post](../lore/genesis-storyline):

>
> Church of Genesis
> Founder: Alfred Ingram Winter
> Leader: E.V.E
> Founding date: 1956
>
> Genesis is a religon official founded on planet earth in the 50's but which
> gained worldwide attenton and popularity in the midst of a viral pandemic & a
> mysterious experiment called NEX GEN.

Additionally, there have been at least two Church of Genxsis events hosted: 
[Downloadfest](downloadfest) and Church of Genxsis Jakarta. There was also a 
Church of Genxsis booth at NexFest Tokyo.

The [unbeleevable video](../for-sof/unbeleevable) also tells us a little more about 
the church of Genxsis and their involvement with the [Mantra cult](../music/amo-mantra).

## Website

The website also contains a personality test and contained a hidden section behind
a password field as well. Sadly, the password protected content could not be 
retrieved from the website.

### Personality test

There are four possible results from the personality test:

![Personality test logo Blessed Exalter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/genxsis.faith/blessed_exalter.png)

> **Blessed Exalter**
>
> Praise highly, so highly upon thee. Words akin to thy-self and ego flow around and off thee like wind and air, words like me and my and I, hold like the weight of a feather in thou hand and fall to the ground. Thou fears not of death, or life or betwixt either of these. But only lives to better thy-self and wish to aid all other beings. Ye reach out with a golden helping hand and grasp all that would reach back.

![Personality test logo Chaos Seeker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/genxsis.faith/chaos_seeker.png)
> **Chaos Seeker**
> 
> The fire consumeth thy soul, it burns and engulfs thine body, limbs and spirit. Ye draw a new pathway upon the map of life, with harsh crudeness and blunt force. Thy line of flame cuts through the social normalities and customs, it tears the map where ye judgement cares not. Thy psyche tips dangerously close to the edge of chaos, tread carefully.

![Personality test logo Destiny Walker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/genxsis.faith/destiny_walker.png)
> **Destiny Walker**
> 
> Ye hopeful and bravest soul, who alloweth thy feet to walk one step timely along thy destined pathway. O great journey, O destined roadmap, carved out like fateful paving stones before thou. Ye Destiny Walker cares not for sight, for thee passageway was meant for thy feet even if thou was rendered blind, even if thou was lost in the great unknown thou would light the true direction with thine very first step. Worry not on the twists and turns of your quest, as whichever doorway thou chooses it will be fated true.

![Personality test logo Logic Dweller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/genxsis.faith/logic_dweller.png)

> **Logic Dweller**
> 
> Logic is thine guiding light and it burns brightly within thine chest while the school of thought acts as thy beacon of judgement. Ye take precious time, to think and meditate in calm and focused serenity on the choices of lifeâ€™s pathways. Each option is weighed on the scales of truth and righteousness. Not without wrongs and mistakes as ye dwell on deep contemplation, however thy focus has never been of saint, but of the wise, humbled direction and focus.

### Other website content

The following two images also appear on the website, they are
labeled as `key.png` and `pgminev1973.png` respectively.

![key.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/genxsis.faith/key.png)
![pmginev1973.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/genxsis.faith/pmginev1973.png)

The `key.png` logo is often used with Nex Gen. The `pgminev1973.png` only
seems to appear on this website and on the cult robes from [DownloadFest](downloadfest)
and possibly the Church of Genxsis Event in Jakarta.

## Affirmations

During the Brit Awards 2024, a bot named Alfred Ingram Winter was on the 
official BMTH Discord, encouraging members to vote for the band. This bot later 
changed to become E.V.E. roughly around the release of Nex Gen.

Before Ingram's disappearance, he posted the following affirmations 
from the Church of Genxsis to the announcements channel:
