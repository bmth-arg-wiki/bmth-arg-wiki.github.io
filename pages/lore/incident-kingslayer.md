Project Kingslayer is a twisted experiment to reach enlightenment through torture. Cult leader [Skys](../characters/skys) 
was an influential man, leading the [Mantra Cult/Neosages](mantra) with his many allies. The research was supported 
by brilliant scientists [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) and [Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman). 
Skys also had a close friend by the name of [Alfgram](../characters/alfgram), who he built the foundations 
of [Ecliptism](ecliptism) with.

## Background

Project Kingslayer takes place in the Neosages cult, better known as the [Cult of Mantra](mantra). The cult had 
established itself at a location named October Palace years earlier, after Skys returned to Novosovia in 2004. 
Skys' mystical powers had convinced Lauren and Strassman to join him in his experiments, despite Dallus' initial hesitation. 

In 2015, Operation Kingslayer started, with the goal of torturing others to achieve mysterious powers and access 
to other dimensions. [Alfgram](../characters/alfgram) was the first to accomplish this, becoming patient zero 
for the operation.

Shortly after starting the project, Skys sent out a message to the youth of Novosovia looking to recruit. 
The message fell into the hands of [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), leader of [Arc/Hive](archive). 
He was a powerful leader in the [DTC](dtc) that was in a Cold War with Skys' home country of [Novosovia](novosovia). 
Wanting the research for himself, he sends in his daughter under the code name [Medea](../characters/medea) to seduce 
Skys and gain access to his knowledge. It was love at first sight for Skys, and Medea eventually falls for Skys' too, 
having at least two babies with him, according to the [third episode of Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable3).

The escalation of the cult's practices and his recent fatherhood causes [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) 
to grow more distant from the cult. Dallus had a son named [Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren) with his 
wife [Elena Lauren](../characters/elena-lauren).

In 2020, the cult of Mantra falls when the Novosovian government intervenes in an event named the October Massacre, 
after the October Palace the cult resides in. The trinity, Skys, Dallus, and Strassman, are rescued in 
[Operation Trinity](operation-trinity) as ordered by Arc/Hive. Along with the men, the company extracts several others to the 
DTC, including the men's families and six special children (later mentioned in the [Project D.U.S.T. proposal](../for-sof/project_dust)). 
Elena Lauren goes into labour with [Lyra Lauren](../characters/lyra-lauren) during this operation, but eventually 
successfully gives birth at Arc/Hive.

[Project D.U.S.T.](incident-dust) is Carmine's continuation of Operation Kingslayer, an acronym for Deaths Unknown 
Spiritual Terrain (referring to the October Massacre). [Sof](../characters/sof) speculates in their [journal](../website/journal) 
that even the [Chapel incident in 2040](incident-chapel) seems to be a consequence of the research into 
Skys' powers that started with the Mantra cult.

[Rebecca's](../characters/rebecca) [2036 Grumblr](../for-sof/grumblr2) refers to Skys as "The Brain Butcher", which 
is seemingly the nickname the public gave him for his horrific experiments during Operation Kingslayer.
