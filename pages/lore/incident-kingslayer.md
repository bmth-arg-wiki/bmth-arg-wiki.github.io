# Project Kingslayer

Project Kingslayer is [Skys](../characters/skys) twisted experiment to reach enlightenment. He was an influential man, 
leading the [Cult of Mantra](mantra) with his many allies. [Alfgram](../characters/alfgram) offered himself 
up to be patient zero and unlocked mysterious powers.

## Background

Shortly after starting his research, Skys sent out a message to the youth of Novosovia looking to recruit. 
The message fell into the hands of [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), leader of [Arc/Hive](archive). 
He was a powerful leader in the [DTC](dtc) that was in a Cold War with Skys' home country of [Novosovia](novosovia). 
Wanting the research for himself, he sends in his daughter under the code name [Medea](../characters/medea) to seduce 
Skys. Its love at first sight for Skys and Medea eventually falls for Skys' charm, having at least two babies with 
 him, according to the [third episode of Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable3).

Project Kingslayer causes [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) to grow more distant from the cult, having 
just become a father for the first time to [Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren).

In 2020, the cult of Mantra falls and the men behind the cult are rescued in [Operation Trinity](operation-trinity).
