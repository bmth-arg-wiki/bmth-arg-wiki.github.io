The [website for downloadfest](https://www.genxsis.faith/) is still up and  contains a cypher.

The cypher can be obtained by clicking the symbol in the upper right corner.

It is sometimes used to spell out "BRING ME THE HORIZON" (pictured above) or "NEX GEN" on  current [promotional material](../socials).
