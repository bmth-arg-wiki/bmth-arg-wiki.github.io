# Downloadfest

The Downloadfest event introduced [the Church of Genxsis](church) and seems to hold lore significance.

## genxsis.faith

The [website for downloadfest](https://www.genxsis.faith/) is still up and contains a cypher. This alternative 
alphabet is still used on different types of promotional material in 2025.

The cypher can be obtained by clicking the symbol in the upper right corner.

![Bring Me The Horizon in the cypher symbols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/other-webpages/bmth_cypher.png)

It is sometimes used to spell out "BRING ME THE HORIZON" (pictured above) or "NEX GEN" on current [promotional material](../socials).

## Downloadfest on Social Media

A post on Downloadfest from Oli depicts early art of Sof, notably with no serial number on M8's head present.

This post also provided what seems to be an initial draft for the lore about the church, 
which is documented on the [Genesis Storyline page](genesis-storyline). This information does seem to conflict 
with information later presented officially through Sof's [journal](../website/journal.md).
