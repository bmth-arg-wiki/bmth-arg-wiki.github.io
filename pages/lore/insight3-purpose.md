> This insight serves as a guiding principle for individuals on their journey to fulfilling their true calling. 
>
> When one commits to aligning themselves with their purpose and dedicating themselves to the highest possible expression of their talents and abilities, they nurture the very scars that plague them.
>
> By striving to discover their true calling, individuals are not only honouring their purpose but also contributing to the greater good. Each action, no matter how small, becomes an opportunity to express their purpose and make a positive impact on the world around them. 
>
> Additionally, the insight encourages individuals to approach their purpose with dedication and passion, knowing that their efforts are not in vain but contribute to the greater unfolding of their destiny.
