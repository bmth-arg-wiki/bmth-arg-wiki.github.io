## Speculation

![Selene's map, with the prince of Death labelled](../../Resources/insights/purpose/princeofdeath.png)

The Prince of Death might be the curse of this Insight, according to 
[Selene's map](../files/for-sof#YOUTOPIA_selenes_mapvis). However, following that logic 
the Babylon would be both the curse and the omen of [Vision](insight4-vision).
