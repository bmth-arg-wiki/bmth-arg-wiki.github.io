# Project D.U.S.T

Project Deaths Unknown Spiritual Terrain (D.U.S.T.) was proposed by lead researcher 
[Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem). He was working for [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine) 
in the [DTC](../lore/dtc), which was at war with Novosovia.

***

## Background

Project D.U.S.T. was a continuation of [Project Kingslayer](incident-kingslayer), a dangerous experiment 
from the [Cult of Mantra](mantra). The cult was located in [Novosovia](novosovia), which was in a long Cold War 
with the [DTC](dtc) at the time. [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), head of [Arc/Hive](archive) and an influential 
figure in the DTC, ordered [Operation Trinity](operation-trinity) to extract the men and get access to their research.

### Cult Infiltration

The first attempt to continue the Kingslayer research came in 2015, when Carmine got his hands on a secret message from 
[Skys](../characters/skys) to the youth of Novosovia. With the cult actively recruiting, Carmine decided to send in his 
daughter under the fake name [Medea](../characters/medea). However, she fell in love with Skys and broke contact with him.

### October Massacre

Victor would finally succeed in gaining access to the project research during the October Massacre at the end of 2020. 
This event signifies the fall of the Mantra cult, after the government of [Novosovia](novosovia) attempted to intervene at October Palace. 
Novosovia was a very religious country with strong government control, which led to the conflict with the cult located 
there. However, they did not expect the cult members to resist their soldiers using terrifying psychological powers.

Meanwhile, Carmine orchestrated Operation Trinity, to extract the most important men in the cult: the trinity of 
Skys, Karl Strassman and Dallus Lauren. Additionally, he extracted their families and a mysterious "special six", 
later mentioned in the [project proposal](../for-sof/project_dust). After a successful extraction, Carmine could now 
continue the research they had started at the October Palace.

### Project Proposal

Now in possession of the Project Kingslayer research, Arc/Hive could start working on several 
projects of their own. The main goal was to develop a potent bioweapon: D.U.S.T, but Dr. Mortem also 
requested funding into the potential of P.S.Y. (Psychoactive Structured Yttrium).

The proposal starts with motivation for the project: the potential to harness dark matter and an interest 
in spiritual transcendence. There is also a political factor, since the same knowledge might already be 
in the hands of others. After ethical consideration, they decided to work with subjects with dangerous powers 
extracted from the Mantra cult.

![altilium chordata tank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/inthedark/gallery/f_altiliumchordatatank.png)

Mortem proposes development of a phase 2 Altilium Chordata tank, with a schematic attached. We later see the 
realised version of this tank in the official video for [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark). According to Sof's 
[journal](../website/journal), the tanks keep subjects alive while subjecting them to hell, with the goal of unlocking 
higher dimensions (like [Youtopia](youtopia)).

The second request for funding is for more research into P.S.Y., Psychoactive Structured Yttrium. It seems this 
is what allowed the cult members to incapacitate hundreds of troops. The soldiers would see terrifying psychological 
hallucinations, which are often referred to as [mares](mares). Dallus' son [Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren) also had visions 
of these mares, producing drawings that suggest that these abilities might be able to be passed down to the next 
generations.

[Nex Gen](nex-gen-corporation) declassified the project proposal document on its 10-year anniversary in 2031, leaving many 
lines and occasionally words and names redacted.

### Project Dreamseeker

In 2037, a disaster referred to as the "Cradle Crash" in an [interview with Carmine](../for-sof/carmine_interview) happens 
at Arc/Hive. Shortly after this incident, the company re-brands to Nex Gen. October 2037 is also the month 
[Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren) passes away and the month that E.V.E. is activated by his son Ren. 
The [LBR sites letter](../for-sof/lbr_sites) from 2038 mentions that the catastrophic event was caused by energy 
exchanges with Dallus' consciousness.

Even though the LBR sites letter is still addressed to Carmine, the research from Project D.U.S.T. continues 
in a new project headed by [E.V.E.](../characters/eve): [Project Dreamseeker](dreamseeker). E.V.E. believes 
that the way forward in their destroyed world is to send people to Youtopia, something she first accomplishes 
with [Selene](../characters/selene) with the assistance of neurospiritualist [Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman). 
Her means of reaching this dimensions are the Dreamseeker tanks and the drug [P.U.S.S-E](pusse).

### Chapel Incident

The Chapel Incident is the last known major incident on the timeline, occurring in February 2040. Sof learns that 
Dr. Elias Mortem and his team lost their lives shortly after she was born, after they were slaughtered by physical 
versions of the mares. They are known as voidlings and result from the [VSPR-37](vspr37) pandemic, which also started 
in October 2037. Sof speculates that Mortem died as a result of his own research, as a result of Project D.U.S.T. 
and the dark side of Youtopia.
