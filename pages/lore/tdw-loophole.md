### What is a Loop-Hole? And Other Questions About Lupamine

> Lupamine, the controversial tranquilizer created by NEX GEN to control their genetically resurrected Lycans, 
> has become a street menace. Its most dangerous side effect? The loop-hole—a dissociative, 
> feral state where users lose all grip on reality, trapped in terrifying hallucinations and primal behavior. 
> Users report feeling like they've become part of a predatory nightmare, unable to control violent urges.
>
> The Rise of Lupamine Addiction
>
> Even high-profile figures like Rebecca Sinclair, the world's first synthetic human, 
> have fallen victim to Lupamine's addictive grip. Sinclair, originally a symbol of hope for humanity's future, 
> became the most infamous case of Lupamine addiction. After her public transformation, 
> she spiraled into regular abuse of Lupamine, experiencing repeated loop-holes during her downward trajectory.
>
> Her case made headlines, as synthetic bodies were once believed immune to addiction. 
> Instead, Sinclair's synthetic form amplified Lupamine's effects, 
> prolonging her loop-hole phases and heightening the ferocity of her behavior. 
> The once-revered figure descended into a life of violence, erratic outbursts, and public meltdowns, 
> fueled by her drug-induced psychosis.
>
> Legal Status and Addiction Rates
>
> Lupamine's rapid spread through the DTC (Disunited Territories of Columbia) has caused concern among law enforcement 
> and medical professionals. While it is still legally distributed to military forces, it has become a Class A controlled 
> substance for civilians. Authorities struggle to control its black-market trade, 
> and its addictive nature has torn through communities, creating a crisis worse than any previous drug epidemic.
>
> Despite warnings, Lupamine use is skyrocketing,with up to 12% of DTC citizens having experimented with the drug at least once.
> Medical professionals continue to raise alarms about its unpredictable side effects and its tendency to 
> trigger violent psychosis.
>
> How Dangerous is Lupamine?
>
> Lupamine was initially marketed as a way to pacify and control the Lycans, but once it hit the streets, 
> it quickly became a recreational drug. Users inject or inhale the drug to experience heightened strength and 
> dissociative trips. However, it's the loop-holes that can turn deadly-hallucinations so intense they lead users to 
> lash out violently, often resulting in injuries to themselves or those around them.
>
> Long-term users report memory loss, increased aggression, paranoia, and vivid flashbacks. 
> The drug warps brain chemistry, leaving people desperate for more to maintain their high while slipping further from reality. 
> Some have become permanently stuck in a semi-loop-hole state, their minds forever trapped in a hallucinatory world of 
> fear and hunting.
>
> [Image of: “Lupamine promotional photograph)
>
> Sinclair's story may have brought Lupamine into the spotlight, but she is far from the only victim. 
> As more users fall into loop-holes and are trapped in their own private nightmares, 
> the question remains— how many more lives will it take before the DTC truly gets a handle on the Lupamine crisis?
>
