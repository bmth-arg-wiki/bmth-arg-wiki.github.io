# Operation Trinity

Operation Trinity marked the end of the [cult of Mantra](mantra). The operation was ordered by 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), wanting the research about [Project Kingslayer](incident-kingslayer) 
for himself. At the time, Carmine is the head of [Arc/Hive](archive), a powerful company in the [DTC](dtc).

***

## Background

The operation was mostly focused on the Trinity, as they possessed invaluable knowledge. Carmine had been 
looking for this information since 2015, when he also sent in his daughter under the alias [Medea](../characters/medea). 
She eventually meets her end in the music video for [MANTRA (song)](../music/amo-mantra), which is later 
confirmed by both the journalist and Carmine in a [reconstructed interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview).

[Dallus](../characters/dallus-lauren) writes his [journal](../for-sof/dallus-diary) shortly after Operation Trinity. 
Strassman was keeping his relationship with [Ava](../characters/ava) a secret from [Skys](../characters/skys), because 
he was told that she was off-limits. In the diary we find out that Ava is now dead and his child Angel is also missing 
and presumed dead. 
Dallus himself had better luck: his wife [Elena](../characters/elena-lauren) went into childbirth 
during Operation Trinity, birthing the healthy [Lyra](../characters/lyra-lauren) in the safety of Arc/Hive's labs. 
His son [Ikaro Lauren](../characters/ren) also escaped unharmed and is already showing promising signs for a career 
in robotics. 

The diary also reveals that Karl Strassman and Dallus now reside in [New Elysium](new-elysium). He admits they've been placed 
in a beautiful community, but wishes they were not separated from their families. On behalf of Arc/Hive, Dallus will 
start working on the MOXYPAKS (air purification devices) and the [SYNTH](synths) project.

Shortly after Operation Trinity, [Project D.U.S.T.](incident-dust) is proposed by [Dr. Elias Mortem](../characters/elias-mortem) 
as a continuation of [Project Kingslayer](incident-kingslayer).
