# Other webpages

A few other pages have been relevant to the investigation, mostly 
including [social media pages](socials).

***

## joinmantra.org

See [Mantra](lore/mantra) for more details on the Mantra launch website. Please be aware that this website is currently 
under different ownership. However, you can still visit it on the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/joinmantra.org).

## genxsis.faith

![Cypher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/genxsis.faith/cypher.png)

A cypher found on a [Genxsis webpage](https://genxsis.faith) was re-used in the ARG, as evidenced 
by the use of these symbol in different promotional posts. Also see the 
page on [downloadfest](lore/downloadfest).

## Dungeoncrawl33r.com

![Secrets to be found (about me page)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/other-webpages/dungeoncrawler_secretstobefound.jpg)

[This site](https://dungeoncrawl33r.com) seems relevant to the lore of the ARG and states that it contains secrets. 
It uses some references the ARG also uses and some bar codes on social media posters have linked 
directly to this website.
It also has coordinates on the front page pointing to the Temple of Solomon.

The website also has an Instagram page, where its logo, the Heart of Chaos sigil is also mentioned here in the 
same way the six-pointed star is in the ARG.
