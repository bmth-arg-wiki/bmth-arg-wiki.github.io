# Multidimensional Navigator 8 Webpage

Most of the ARG takes place in the Multidimensional Navigator. You can access 
it with the following link.

`https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html`

## Password

![Log in screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/Bring-Me-The-Horizon-website-shot.png)

<details class="password">
<summary>Password:</summary> 

93934521

</details>

The password to boot in safe mode is the serial number on the side of M8's
head. It can be found on the album cover (although the serial number is very tiny).

## QR Code

The QR code for the website was found at the end of the [spectrogram](music/spectrograms) 
in the song DIg It.

## Website contents

The web page leads us to what looks like a personal computer. Here we can find some music, 
some avatars corresponding to different characters and more. 
We have a folder on our computer [FOR SOF](for-sof), 
which will be the next step to unlocking the mysteries of Youtopia.

### Access card

![Access card on the website (current)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/access-card2.png)

This access card seems to indicate who we are accessing the 
[Multidimensional Navigator 8](m8) as.
The access level is currently at level 2, only being at level 4 for a brief while after 
the ARG first launched.

The content seems to read as following:

> ACCESS CARD MS: M8 [illegible]-OK!
>
> NEX GEN presents [Dreamseeker variant] 2024 OST + A POST HUMAN STUDY (phase II)
>
> PATIENT 00029
>
> ACCESS LVL 2
>
> PH2222 0036
>
> Nex Gen (93)
>
> NG (symbol) MB (symbol) P.u.s.s-e (symbol)

The text below mentions something about two doses of [p.u.s.s.-e](lore/pusse) a day and 
going 'deeper'.

### Youtopia Stability Meter

The stability meter seems to fluctuate slightly while you are visiting the page, not 
changing all too much as of 31/05/2024.

### Weather Module

![Before weather update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/weather_2605_old.png)

The weather as displayed before the 26th of May update. It was then 
changed to the image below for a while and currently displays this card again.

![After weather update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/weather_update_26_05.png)

The weather as displayed after the 26th of May update for roughly 1-2 months.

### Buttons

The page also provides a button to manage your Wi-fi, which will likely be needed to access the browser. 
The Codek messaging app also states that it needs a connection to the internet.

Wi-fi options menu

![Website button with M8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/webpage-button-m8.png)

Website button with M8 on it shows us some system information.

![System specs?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/system_specs.png)

The last button in the row shows us what looks like system specifications, including the 
serial number we used to access the webpage.
