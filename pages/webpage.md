# Multidimensional Navigator 8 Webpage

Most of the ARG takes place in the Multidimensional Navigator, a fictional piece of technology that 
is also our character [M8](m8). You can access it with the following link: 

[https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html](https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html)

As of December 4th 2024, it has under-went a complete makeover as M8 was able to update herself after being connected to the [wifi](lore/wifi).
Here is the new look:

## Password

![New log in screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/new-password-screen.png)

<details class="password">
<summary>Password:</summary> 

93934521

</details>

The password to boot M8 in safe mode is the serial number on the side of her head. 
It can be found on the album cover (although the serial number is very tiny).

## QR Code

The QR code for the website was found at the end of the [spectrogram](music/spectrograms) 
in the song DIg It.

We do not recommend trying to scan this barcode, using the link above is much easier!

## Website Contents

The web page leads us to what looks like a personal computer. Here we can find some music, 
some avatars corresponding to different characters and more. 
We have a folder on our computer [FOR SOF](for-sof), 
which will be the next step to unlocking the mysteries of Youtopia.

***

## Inventory

![inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/inventory.png)

A brand-new [Inventory](for-sof/for-sof) feature was added during the December update. 
Files in this folder are protected by puzzles. 

***

## Website Songs

[See article on the songs on the website](music/website-songs). The player is called Noctune.

***

## Spyder

Spyder is the in-universe [web browser](lore/webbrowser) on the page. 

***

## Journal

![journal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/journal.png)

The Dec, 4th 2024 update brought us [Sof's journal](lore/journal).

***

## Website Users

The website users are all [characters](characters) with their own dedicated pages.

***

## Buttons

{% include gallery.html folder="webpage/newbuttons" %}

The new buttons are virtually the same as the old ones, their main difference being their design and placement.
They are now in the top right corner of the website.

![emulator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/emulator.png)

There is also an `Emulator` button that looks like a controller in the middle of the page.
It leads to [ScreamStar](https://www.scream-star.com/).

## Old Features

### Old Overview & Password Screen

### Codek

![Screenshot of the codek on the website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/kodek.png)

This dialogue was shown briefly before getting a message that we needed to connect to the 
internet first to use the messaging app. After connecting to the [wi-fi](lore/wifi), we still 
sadly could not access the codek, since M8 was updating and a firewall prevented us from accessing the 
full capabilities of the wi-fi.

As of the December 4th 2024 update, the Codek tab has entirely disappeared.

### Access Card

![Access card on the website (current)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/access-card2.png)

This access card seemed to indicate who we were accessing the 
[Multidimensional Navigator 8](m8) as.
The access level was at level 2, only being at level 4 for a brief while after 
the ARG first launched.

The card read as following:

> ACCESS CARD MS: M8 [illegible]-OK!
>
> NEX GEN presents [Dreamseeker variant] 2024 OST + A POST HUMAN STUDY (phase II)
>
> PATIENT 00029
>
> ACCESS LVL 2
>
> PH2222 0036
>
> Nex Gen (93)
>
> NG (symbol) MB (symbol) P.u.s.s-e (symbol)

The text below mentioned something about two doses of [p.u.s.s.-e](lore/pusse) a day and 
going 'deeper'.

### Youtopia Stability Meter

![Stability meter for Youtopia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/youtopia_stability.png)

The stability meter seemed to fluctuate slightly while you were visiting the page, not 
changing all too much as of 31/05/2024.

### Weather Module

![Before weather update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/weather_2605_old.png)

The weather as displayed before the 26th of May update. It was then 
changed to the image below for a while and then displayed this card again.

![After weather update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/weather_update_26_05.png)

The weather as displayed after the 26th of May update for roughly 1-2 months.

### Buttons

{% include gallery.html folder="webpage/buttons" %}

The page also provided a button to manage your [Wi-fi](lore/wifi), which will likely be needed to access the browser. 
The Codek messaging app also stated that it needs a connection to the internet. The website button with M8 on it showed us some system information.

The last button in the row showed us what looks like system specifications, including the 
serial number we used to access the webpage.

### Website Backgrounds

{% include gallery.html folder="webpage/gallery" %}

Before its big makeover, the website used to have a few wallpapers that you could rotate to your liking.
