The following message also unlocked a few Discord channels, one for each insight, the 
core values and a podium channel.

> Good evening @everyone

> As you know, our Earth has been ravaged following the terrible virus that spread 
> like wildfire across our beautiful planet. However, we at NeX GEn dedicated 
> ourselves to control, I mean rebuild society from the ashes. We have been able 
> to go deeper than anyone else has before, and we have found salvation !

> we have been able to probe the innermost recesses of her mind. Within this domain, 
> she found herself ensnared in a dreamscape beyond her wildest imagination. She named 
> this place Youtopia, a domain accessible to every human, with definitely no side effects. if you, too, wish to access Youtopia, all you need to do is…

This message confirmed Selene as the immune child from the [Dreadit post](../files/dreadit). 
However, from the [Strassman codec](../files/strassmancodec) we already know E.V.E. is lying about 
the lack of side effects.

> to unlock Youtopia, but I’m back.
>
> The first step on your journey to Youtopia: Connection.
>
> Connection is not just about forging bonds with others but also about developing 
> a profound understanding of your own essence. In the journey towards Youtopia, Emily discovered that true connection starts from within. She encountered various versions of herself, each representing different facets of her personality and potential. Through this introspective exploration, she realised that love begins with self-love and acceptance.
