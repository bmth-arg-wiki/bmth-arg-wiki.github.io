Since we are currently still unlocking the many files in the file folder, it is unknown when we will start a next step.

## Step 0: Listen to the album

You are probably here because you did this already! However, if you didn't, go listen 
to the **full** album first.
The [ost]'s also have relevance to the plot.

Additionally,
you can get a feel for the setting and lore by watching the music videos and checking out Bring Me The Horizon on 
YouTube, Instagram, X and Threads.

## Step 1: The Website

The first step is to gain access to the ARG website.

### Finding the website

The first step is to find the website.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

At the end of Dig It we hear a funny little robot and some weird sounds. There is 
definitely more hidden there!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

You're going to have to use some kind of 
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

There is a hidden QR code in the [spectrogram](music/spectrograms) and it leads us to
https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html.
</details>

Once you have found the website,
you can click around to learn more about the different functionalities it has to offer.
You can also read more about them on this wiki.

### Gaining access

To gain access to the website we need to enter our first password.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

To find the code, we need the serial number of M8, the robot on the website.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take a closer look at the album cover of NEx Gen.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The serial number we are looking for is 93934521 and can be seen on the side of M8's head 
on the [NEx Gen album](music/ph-nex-gen) cover.
</details>

We're in! You should now be able to explore the ARG website.

## Step 2: The files

The folder of files is where most of the ARG takes place. First we need to gain access to it.

### The folder

The folder can be found on the left side of the webpage. It's orange with an interesting 
symbol on it.
When we click the folder, we find out that it's locked!

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

The password can be found by taking a good look at the ARG website itself.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take a good look at the system time; you'll notice that there is something off about it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The password for the folder is "past". We don't have an official explanation for this, but it is assumed 
to be the password due to the time discrepancies on the webpage.
</details>

You can find more explanations about the webpage by reading some related articles.

### Files 1-2

The first file is an [audio log](files/msgforsof) and the second is a document. Neither of them require a password. 
Before doing some more research, we recommend opening the next set of files first.

### Files 3-6

Files 3-6 are a set of four, as is visible from their filenames. Their password screens 
contain hints in the form of symbols.

<details>
<summary>Files hint 1</summary>

As you can gather from the file names, the passwords are related to the four insights 
we just read about.
These were actually revealed in multiple social media posts, so take a look on Instagram or X.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Files hint 2</summary>

There is more hidden in the audio on NEx Gen. Have a look at the songs again!
</details>

Solutions:
<details>
<summary>Solution first file</summary>

The first insight is 'connection', as seen in some social media posts.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution second file</summary>

The second insight is 'empathy'.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution third file</summary>

The third insight is 'purpose'.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution fourth file</summary>

</details>

These files will tell us more about the lore, but we are only just at the start.
