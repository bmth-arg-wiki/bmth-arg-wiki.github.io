# M8

> "Greetings, meatbag!"

M8, short for Multidimensional Navigator 8, is a system helping us on our journey. It is revealed by Selene in the 
[FOR SOF audiolog](for-sof) that M8 is a *she*. She is hiding the secrets of the past from [SOF](characters/sof), 
with Selene hinting there might be a good reason for that in the same audio recording. From the [booklet](lore/booklet) we 
also learn that M8 raised Sof.

She is also user 0006 in the system for the website. M8 was developed by [Ikaro Lauren](characters/ren), son of renowned 
scientist [Dr. Dallus Lauren](characters/dallus-lauren). There are at least two predecessors to M8: [R8](for-sof/r8) 
and [D8](for-sof/lauren_d8_log).

> - M8 when prompted with "Who are u?"

M8 is an AI assistant with the difficult task of raising demi-god Sof, after Selene had to leave her shortly after birth. 
M8 was developed at [Nex Gen Corporation](lore/nex-gen-corporation), as part of the 8-line by [Ikaro Lauren](characters/ren). 
Sof was born on February 25th 2040, putting M8's creation somewhere before this time.

[R8](for-sof/r8) was able to re-construct the past and its specifications mention that it came before M8. [D8](for-sof/lauren_d8_log) 
was an assistant to record and reflect on lab experiments, first in operation during the day of [E.V.E.](characters/eve)'s 
creation on the 24th of October 2037.

The booklet tells us more about M8's capabilities: it states that she uses sensors and advanced communication systems to 
transmit footage from Youtopia to Nex Gen's labs. This footage is made of grainy low-frequency images and audio, 
which is why it would likely seem distorted or to be using a bad signal when seen at the lab. The name Multidimensional 
Navigator 8 in itself is also telling about her ability to communicate with multiple dimensions, including our own 
real world through her questions to the BMTH Discord-community.
