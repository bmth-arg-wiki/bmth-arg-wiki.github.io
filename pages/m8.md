![M8 image](../Resources/m8/m8_character.png)

M8, short for Multidimensional Navigator 8, is a system helping us on our journey. It is revealed by Selene in the 
[FOR SOF audiolog](files/for-sof) that M8 is a *she*. She is hiding the secrets of the past from [SOF](characters/sof.md), 
with Selene hinting there might be a good reason for that in the same audio recording.
