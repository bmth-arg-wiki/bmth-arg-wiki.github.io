M8, short for Multidimensional Navigator 8, is a system helping us on our journey. It is revealed by Selene in the 
[FOR SOF audiolog](for-sof) that M8 is a *she*. She is hiding the secrets of the past from [SOF](characters/sof), 
with Selene hinting there might be a good reason for that in the same audio recording. From the [booklet](lore/booklet) we 
also learn that M8 raised Sof.

She is also user 0006 in the system for the website.

## Background

> *"I can also chat with our home planet; Earth. Realtime data transfer straight to the all powerful and all glorious EVE!
She's the big boss. The head honcho. The one pulling the strings! Anything we find, Eve knows about it instantly.
So, no pressure."*

> - M8 when prompted with "Who are u?"

M8 is an AI assistant with the difficult task of raising demigod Sof, after Selene had to leave her shortly after birth. 
M8 was developed at [Nex Gen Corporation](lore/nex-gen-corporation), as part of the 8-line. She seems more advanced than 
[R8](for-sof/r8), which only reconstructs the past. The last known part of the 8-line so far is [D8](for-sof/lauren_d8_log), 
an assistant that documents trials in the Nex Gen labs, occasionally adding their own critical analysis of the situation.

The booklet tells us more about M8's capabilities: it states that she uses sensors and advanced communication systems to 
transmit footage from Youtopia to Nex Gen's labs. This footage is made of grainy low-frequency images and audio, 
which is why it would likely seem distorted or to be using a bad signal when seen at the lab.
