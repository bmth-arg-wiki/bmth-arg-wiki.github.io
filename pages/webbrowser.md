# Web Browser - Spyder

The web browser is called Spyder. It seems that a Wi-Fi password is needed before we can use it. 
Its current URL is `https://www.dreaddit.com/d/conspiracy/comments/1d1b2c2a`.

The error code reads: `error_tp10a2uhd7amnSTCB`

The URL used to be `surfr.news/2d85da7-f5cc-45a4-ad44`, before it changed to its current URL 
for the [Dreaddit file](for-sof/dreadit).

## Current findings

- Error code likely refers (partially) to [Top 10 Statues That Cried Blood](music/song-top10)
- When the first URL changed, it lead to the password for the [Dreaddit file](for-sof/dreadit) 
being unlocked.

## Trivia

- Before the Dreaddit file, you could type in the address bar. This did not lead to any clues.
