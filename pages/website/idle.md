The game centers around [Sof](../characters/sof), who is in their room uploading files. The aim of the 
game is to upload as many files as possible and upgrade your room.

## About

In the idle game your goal is to click your keyboard to upload files. Uploaded files are a currency that can be used 
to upgrade your room. USB stick upgrades, extension cords and plants are sold under the upgrades tab and will help you upload more 
files.

Upgrading for the first time unlocks tasks, where you can clean your desk. Progressing will unlock the tasks to install 
speakers and wake up [M8](../m8). After cleaning your desk you can start upgrading your room with cosmetics. 

Using the cellphone, you can also call in Ren or Strassman, which will then sit behind the computer 
to upload the files instead.
