# Worm

Worm is one of the games in the emulator on the [website](website). It does not require a password. 

Worm is a snake-like game, where you move around using WASD or your arrow keys. The goal is to collect as many 
[Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) logos as possible, while avoiding collision with other worms, your own tail 
or the wall.
