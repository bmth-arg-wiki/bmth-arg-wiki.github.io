# Emulator

The Emulator button on the dashboard came with the December 4th update in 2024. At first, the emulator only allowed us 
to play the game [Scream Star](emulator-screamstar).

Since the April 11th update, it is now possible to play [Scream Star](emulator-screamstar) from the ARG website. Additionally, 
the [painting puzzle](emulator-escape) can be solved to access [M8 Mobile](emulator-m8mobile).
