# Emulator

The Emulator button on the dashboard came with the December 4th update in 2024. At first, the emulator only allowed us 
to play the game [Scream Star](emulator-screamstar).

Since the April 11th update, it is now possible to play Scream Star on the ARG website. Additionally, a mysterious escape 
game requiring a password appeared. As of now, the password has not been cracked.
