# Walkthrough: FOR SOF

**[← previous](walkthrough)**

After exploring the ARG website for the first time, we can start to learn more by unlocking files. 
`FOR SOF` is the folder of files where most of the ARG takes place.
First, we need to gain access to it!

***

## The folder

The folder can be found on the left side of the webpage. It's orange with an interesting
symbol on it.
When we click the folder, we find out that it's locked!

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
The password can be found by taking a good look at the ARG website itself.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Take a good look at the system time; you'll notice that there is something off about it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
The password for the folder is "past". We don't have an official explanation for this, but it is assumed
to be the password due to the time discrepancies on the webpage.
</details>

You can find more explanations about the webpage by reading some related articles.

<details>
<summary>About the webpage</summary>

## Insight files

Files 3–6 are a set of four, as is visible from their filenames. Their password screens
contain hints in the form of symbols.

<details>
<summary>Files hint 1</summary>
As you can gather from the file names, the passwords are related to the four insights
we just read about.
These were actually revealed in multiple social media posts, so take a look on Instagram or X.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Files hint 2</summary>

There is more hidden in the audio on NEx Gen. Have a look at the songs again!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution first file</summary>

The first insight is 'connection'.
The spectrogram for Top 10 staTues tHat CriEd bloOd
contains this password, but we can also see it in several social media posts.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution second file</summary>

The second insight is 'empathy' and can be found in the spectrogram
in n/A. It can also be seen in social media posts occasionally.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution third file</summary>

The third insight is 'purpose' and can be found in the spectrogram
in [ost] puss-e.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution fourth file</summary>

The fourth insight is 'vision' and can be found in the spectrogram
in DIg It.
</details>

These files will tell us more about the lore, but we are only just at the start.

## CAPSLOCK.DOC

This file is a special case, as it was uncovered before it was supposed to be.
Also see the [article on this file](../../for-sof/capslock_doc).
We recommend reading this file at the end of your walkthrough and not following the instructions
in it.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

You are going to have a closer look at the album track list.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Take the capital letters from the track list and find an anagram that matches
the phrase on the password screen.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

By decoding the capital letters from the track list, we get
'DEKODE THE MATRIX TO ATTAIN YOUR CONCEALED ORIGINS'.
</details>

Let's move on with the file actually intended to be next.

## StrassmanCONFIDENTIALPRT007.CODEC

This time we are working on a video file.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Take a look at the password screen and listen to the album closely.
Any dialogue can be important.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

You are looking for a name and will need to reverse some audio to find it. Good luck!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The password is the name of the character we see on the login screen. We
get the name 'Karl Strassman' from a bulleT w/my namE On.
</details>

In this file we learn about Dr. Strassman, a mysterious employee of Nex Gen. We learn a lot more about his research 
in later files.

## Wi-fi 

At this point we recommend you check out the [wi-fi](../../website/wifi). The password 
for the wi-fi was puzzled together in a special event during the pop-up shops hosted 
across several cities across the world. Each location had a phone with one of the 
characters for the password and a message telling the community to work together. 
This one's a freebie!
