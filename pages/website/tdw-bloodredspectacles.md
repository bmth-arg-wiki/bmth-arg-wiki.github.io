> ### The Phantom Velvet Circle
> 
> ### Inside the Blood-Red Spectacles of the Elite’s Underground Parties
> 
> By Lee M.D., Your Man on the Inside
> 
> Alright, strap on, oops, I mean strap in, cause The Daily Whisper's about to spill the baked beans on the world's most 
> messed up masquerade: The Red Parties. And who's holding court at the centre of this dark twisted fantasy, you ask? 
> None other than Cranky Phip-hop's own scandalous puppet master.
>
> Rumour has it, Cranky P and his high-roller pals are bored of yachts, big pimpin' and private islands. Nope, 
> they've levelled up, toasting their empty lives at exclusive underground dos with a little help from SIMPS- 
> (Subservient Intimate Machine Partner) synthetic, human-like playthings supposedly built to serve. 
> But these aren't just AE gadgets, folks; word is they're actual people, taken from the dregs of society, 
> rewired and retted to obey the whims of the disgustingly rich. It's dystopian excess at its ugliest, 
> but that's just how Cranky P's Velvet Circle rolls.

> ### A Guest List That'll Make You Gag
>
> Imagine this lineup: you've got Lenny Vaprio, that fossil with a talent for keeping his love life Forever Young; Junji Baxter, 
> who ditched pop stardom for the thrill of dodgy G-coin schemes; and all the other wankers that **_fill_** out this circus 
> of twisted egos. These are the big names who've traded morality for a place in Cranky P's blood-red playground, 
> where luxury meets ludacy, and the price of entry is a conscience on life support.
> 
> The whole gang's there: the overpaid, the overdressed, and the over-the-top, all swanning around like they're untouchable, 
> toasting each other with glasses full of something that cost more than the average house.

> ### Grim Evidence Leaked on Dark Frame
> 
> Our hacker mate, (good lad but he stinks) snagged a video before it got scrubbed, and let me tell you, it's pure nightmare fuel. 
> If you haven't seen the footage, Imagine a mansion bathed in bloodred light, rows of SIMPS: human-looking shells - standing motionless, 
> waiting like they're part of the decor, serving overpriced hors d'oeuvres to pricks in thousand-dollar suits. 
> And just when you think the horror show's peaked, one of the SIMPS is led into the centre of the room, 
> stripped down to bare skin, and **_fitted_** with a shiny, new accessory: a collar, 
> cinched by some wealthy bastard with all the fanfare of a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
>
> The SIMP's expression doesn't change - they're empty inside, nothing left of who they once were. But then, it gets darker. 
> This SIMP is led around like a prize, and when they're **_finally_** auctioned **_off_** in front of the whole crowd, 
> the winning bidder walks over, grinning like he's just snagged a rare vintage.
>
> I don't know what's sicker-the fact that it's happening, or the way these guests watch with gleeful, detached smiles, 
> sipping their drinks like they're at some twisted fashion show. Makes your ghoulies go, doesn't it? And the worst part? 
> The whispers are that this is only the public part of the show-rumour has it that what happens behind closed doors at the 
> Red Parties makes this look tame.

> ### Lyrics to Match the Lifestyle
>
> As if Cranky P weren't obvious enough, he's practically dropping his dirty laundry at our feet with his latest (dog shit) banger, 
> Digital Angels. In this little ditty, he's whispering sweet nothings about slick metal kisses and synthetic sins. 
> Real subtle, Cranky. He even spells out S-I-M-P-S in the chorus, practically daring us to catch on. 
> Then there's the line, careful you don't slip / In a house with no grip, as if his Red Parties aren't notorious enough already, 
> where obedience' is apparently included with the valet service.
>
> But the pièce de résistance? Oh, he's got a verse where he purrs about his angels being greased, primed, and endlessly adored. 
> Now, if that isn't the poshest way to brag about owning your own set of wind-up toys, I don't know what is. 
> He's basically doing cartwheels around us, strutting about with his high-priced playthings, 
> and we're here just bopping along like mugs. And to top it **_off_**, in a recent raid, 
> authorities uncovered a staggering 1,000 drums of MOBIL 1 Syn Grease- the crème de la crème of machine oils, 
> as any top-notch gear-head would tell you. But the grease isn't just for maintenance; it's used to keep the SIMPS' synthetic skin lubricated, 
> leaving no pesky **_fingerprints_** or evidence behind. 
>
> Fans and conspiracy nuts are lapping it up, of course. The forums are buzzing with wild theories. 
> Some reckon he's dropping these clues on purpose, showing **_off_** his darkest secrets while the world shrugs it **_off_** as art. 
> And maybe he's right; most people will just sing along without a thought. But for those in the know, 
> Cranky P's lyrics are possibly the sickest brag in music history. One thing's for certain: 
> whether it's an edgy joke or just a washed-up has-been playing God, 
> Cranky P and his Velvet Circle are messing with the kinds of **_fires_** that don't just burn. 
> they destroy. And they don't give a toss about who gets charred. Dirty bastards.
