# Clone Chaos

> It's bloody disgusting, really giving hard-working synths a bad name.

From Julio's violent double, to Zeeva's clone malfunctioning while she's away, passing by Trey's copy having an affair, 
and even Mindstream's ever-growing pile of lawsuits for wrongful deaths by glitchy clones, 
[Lee M.D.](../characters/lee-md) does not hold his tongue about celebrities and their synth clones controversies.

> ### Clone Chaos
> 
> ### Celeb’s Synth Swap Scandals Go Public!
> 
> By Lee M.D., Your Man on the Inside
>
> Alright, hold onto your kegs, because I've got a scoop straight out of the celebrity sausage factory that'll make your stomach turn. 
> Turns out some celebs, in their quest to dodge a bit of graft, have actually turned themselves into SYNTHs just so they can prance around with a shiny, 
> obedient clone in tow. It's narcissism on a nuclear level, and as usual, yours truly is here to serve the dirt on a silver bloody platter.

> ### The “USC” Double-Down Disaster
>
> Get this this: Julio The Mangler Stokes, our follicular challenged **_fighter_** from the Ultimate Smackdown Collective (USC), 
> decides he's too big of a legend to train like a regular human. So what's he do? He becomes a SYNTH just to make a copy of himself, 
> sends SYNTH Julio into the ring, and no prizes for guessing things go tits up. Bonegrinder Hayes, his unfortunate opponent, 
> ends up with a face like mashed turnips. The **_fight_** was so brutal they had to cart half the audience out for shock, 
> and now Bonegrinder's got permanent brain rot, all thanks to Julio's lazy antics. It's bloody disgusting, 
> really giving hard-working synths a bad name.

> ### Pop Star Zeeva's Identity Crisis Goes Global
>
> Next up, SYNTH scandal strikes again with pop star Zeeva, 
> whose SYNTH twin is caught prancing around in Nu-Orion while Zeeva herself is snapped jet-setting in East Chiyoda. 
> Imagine this: Zeeva's synth hits the stage, starts glitching mid-chorus, sounding like a stuck karaoke machine, 
> and her face goes full-on 404. Fans are **_baffled_**, snapping vids, while Zeeva's probably sipping Mai Tais halfway across the world, 
> blissfully unaware of the techno-carnage.
>
> Zeeva's management claims it's some kind of avant-garde performance art. Right. 
> And I'm the sausage **_fingered_** king of inglaterra. These celebs think we were born yesterday. Truth is, half-[cuts off]

> ### Hollywood Heartthrob’s SYNTH Scandal
>
> Ah, the next car crash in this circus: Trey Harlow, Hollywood's golden boy, who reckons he's above a bit of manual labour. 
> He gets a SYNTH double to do the hard work while he chills with his feet up, and what happens? 
> SYNTH-Trey goes and has an **_affair_** with a waitress in New Elysium, no less. Course, 
> Trey's management forgot to remind the SYNTH he's married. Photos hit Dreadlt, the fans go mental, 
> and his wife **_files_** for divorce.

> If you're gonna clone yourself, at least program a bit of loyalty in, yeah? Or maybe, I dunno, 
> don't send your synth double out to **_flirt_** with half the city. Decent, hard-working synths are just trying to do their jobs, 
> then some have to go shagging about and ruining it for the rest of them.

> ### Mindtream’s Stunt Disaster
>
> And **_finally_**, let's not forget Mindstream Studios and their bright idea to send a synth hurtling **_off_** a skyscraper for a stunt. 
> They had it all planned, right? Except the poor SYNTH glitches halfway down and nose-dives into the crowd below, 
> taking out half a dozen poor sods. They've now recalled all SYNTH actors, 
> but the lawsuits are piling up like Maccys wrappers after an all night bender. 
> Mindstream's CEO is taking heat for cutting corners, though frankly, the whole thing stinks worse than a synth's stink pipe after a valve dump.

> ### Is the Clone Craze just Another Passing Fad?
>
> So, are we **_finally_** done with this clone craze, or are we stuck with a load of fake celebs who can't be arsed to show up to their own lives? 
> This whole twin lifestyle might suit them, but let me tell you, it's making life hell for hard-working, 
> honest synths who are just trying to do a day's work without getting dragged into a scandal. 
> If these fancy-pants celebs keep pulling this crap, the public's bound to catch on sooner or later. And when they do, 
> don't say I didn't warn you.
