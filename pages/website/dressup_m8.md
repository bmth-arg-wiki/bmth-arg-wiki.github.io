# M8 Dress-Up Game

The M8 dress-up game was added on the 27th of October 2025. The game includes several options to 
give [M8](../m8) a makeover of your choice, with accessories for her head, face, new wings and more.

To access the game, click the message next to M8 to open the post-it note. Click on M8's head to 
open her dress-up game.

The game contains a secret message when you click on "03 Wings": `fd2piuv08o`. Usually the interface 
says "Recreational styling program // beta". This is theorised to link 
back to the last cipher for the [Carmine Interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview).
