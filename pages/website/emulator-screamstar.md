# Scream Star

[Scream Star](https://www.scream-star.com/) is a rhythm game that includes most of the songs from the 
album [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn](../music/ph-nex-gen). The game can also be connected to your own Spotify.

While it does not seem to expand on the lore, it has a few fun assets and is now also playable through the 
emulator on the website since the 11th of April 2025. This update also introduced the first lore-related game, exclusive 
to the webpage, to the [emulator](emulator) category. The only character that is prominently featured in the 
game is [Eve](../characters/eve).
