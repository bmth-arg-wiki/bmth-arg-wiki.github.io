M8 Mobile is a retro game that can be accessed through the 
[emulator](emulator). The protagonist, our very own [M8](../m8), is in a side-scroller 
game where she can fly and shoot. It is hidden behind the [painting puzzle](emulator-escape).

## About

This is a game within the dashboard with an 8-bit soundtrack of [LosT](../music/song-lost). The game was released on the 
20th of August 2025, along with three more puzzles for the [artifacts](../for-sof/artifacts). To access the game, 
you click on M8 mobile in the [emulator](emulator). This brings up the [painting puzzle](emulator-escape). After this 
puzzle, you can play the game!

In the game, you collect chips, disable barriers and shoot enemies. You have three lives, which are replenished in each stage. The game is played 
in three stages: one with combat and collection, one focused on avoiding obstacles and a boss battle.

The game starts with M8 flying through a city scape, while collecting computer components and shooting at alien-like 
creatures. The second stage is tech-related, seemingly within a computer or in a lab with computers. There are no enemies 
here, and M8's goal is to disable the barriers by shooting at them, while avoiding the chips with the [Genxsis](../lore/church) 
logo.

The final stage is like a boss battle. M8 is threatened by a cannon at the top of the screen and barriers coming 
from either the left or the right. The barriers are prefaced by an exclamation mark on the screen, making them fairly easy 
to avoid by travelling to the other side of the screen. The goal is to bring down the health bar of the Genxsis logo 
by shooting at it.

Finishing the game sadly does not unlock anything. The maximum score seems to be 2900, with points 
being subtracted at least for taking damage.
