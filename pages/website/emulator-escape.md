# Escape Game

> You have entered a small room with three oddly unsettling 
> paintings infront of you. They almost look alive, the sooner you get 
> out of this room the better.

This mysterious game dropped on April 11th and has not been cracked yet. It does not have an official name yet, 
but is most similar to an escape room game.

The image shown seems to contain several glowing numbers and a prompt to "Submit Answer".
