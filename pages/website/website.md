# Multidimensional Navigator 8 Webpage

Most of the ARG takes place in the Multidimensional Navigator, a fictional piece of technology that 
is also our character [M8](../m8). You can access it with the following link: 

[https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html](https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html)

As of December 4th 2024, it has under-went a complete makeover as M8 was able to update herself after being connected to the [Wi-Fi](wifi).
Here is the new look:

## ARG Website - Main Page

{% assign page_links = '/pages/website/wifi, /pages/website/webbrowser, /pages/website/website-songs, /pages/website/journal, /pages/website/website-v1' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

## ARG Website - Spyder Web Browser

### The Daily Whisper

On Sunday 15th December 2024, the access codes for the [web browser](../website/webbrowser) were found.
Spyder opens on newspaper called "The Daily Whisper". Here are the articles found there:

{% assign page_links = '/pages/website/tdw-loophole, /pages/website/tdw-gatekeeper, /pages/website/tdw-vanished, /pages/website/tdw-riseofsynth, /pages/website/tdw-valexlastwords, /pages/website/tdw-riseoflupamine, /pages/website/tdw-mindxscape, /pages/website/tdw-faithedge, /pages/website/tdw-clonechaos, /pages/website/tdw-redwhiteblood, /pages/website/tdw-futureentertainment, /pages/website/tdw-bloodredspectacles, /pages/website/tdw-roguesentinels' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

## Password

![New log in screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/new-password-screen.png)

<details class="password">
<summary>Password:</summary> 

93934521

</details>

The password to boot M8 in safe mode is the serial number on the side of her head. 
It can be found on the album cover (although the serial number is very tiny).

## QR Code

The QR code for the website was found at the end of the [spectrogram](../music/spectrograms) 
in the song DIg It.

We do not recommend trying to scan this barcode, using the link above is much easier!

## Website Contents

The web page leads us to what looks like a personal computer. Here we can find some music, 
some avatars corresponding to different characters and more. 
We have a folder on our computer [FOR SOF](../for-sof/for-sof), 
which will be the next step to unlocking the mysteries of Youtopia.

***

## Inventory

![inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/inventory.png)

A brand-new [Inventory](../for-sof/for-sof) feature was added during the December update. 
Files in this folder are protected by puzzles. 

***

## Website Songs

[See article on the songs on the website](website-songs). The player is called Noctune.

***

## Spyder

Spyder is the in-universe [web browser](webbrowser) on the page. 

***

## Journal

![journal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/journal.png)

The Dec, 4th 2024 update brought us [Sof's journal](journal.md).

***

## Website Users

The website users are all [characters](../characters) with their own dedicated pages.

***

## Buttons

{% include gallery.html folder="webpage/newbuttons" %}

The new buttons are virtually the same as the old ones, their main difference being their design and placement.
They are now in the top right corner of the website.

![emulator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/emulator.png)

There is also an `Emulator` button that looks like a controller in the middle of the page.
It leads to [ScreamStar](https://www.scream-star.com/).
