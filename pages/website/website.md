# Multidimensional Navigator 8 Webpage

Most of the ARG takes place in the Multidimensional Navigator, a fictional piece of technology that 
is also our character [M8](../m8). You can access it with the following link: 

[https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html](https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html)

As of December 4th 2024, it has undergone a complete makeover as M8 was able to update herself after being connected to the [Wi-Fi](wifi).
Here is the new look:

Please note that an additional tab was added for the [idle game](idle) in July 2025.

### The Daily Whisper

On Sunday 15th December 2024, the access codes for the [web browser](../website/webbrowser) were found, 
prompting the discovery of this newspaper; its name being a play on the real life publication 'The Daily Mail'.
As of this date, there are 12 readable articles and 1 inaccessible article as it overrun by pop-up ads.

There are two credited writers: [Lee M.D.](../characters/lee-md), and Gideon Mourningstone.
The columns talk about serious topics in the classic gossip way. 

A common typo is the omission of the letters 'ff', 'fl', 'ffi', 'ffl' or 'fi' in certain words.
Both articles written by Lee and Gideon have this quirk, 
which leads us to believe 'Gideon Mourningstone' might be a pseudonym for Lee M.D.

## Entering the website

The login screen has been consistent, with [M8](../m8) asking to boot her up in safe mode using her serial number.

![New log in screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/new-password-screen.png)

<details class="password">
<summary>Click me to reveal the serial number.</summary> 
{{"
93934521

The password to boot M8 in safe mode is the serial number on the side of her head.
It can be found on the album cover (although the serial number is very tiny).

</details>

The QR code for the website was found at the end of the [spectrogram](../music/spectrograms) 
in the song DIg It.

We do not recommend trying to scan this barcode, using the link above is much easier!

## Website Contents

The web page leads us to what looks like a personal computer. Here we can find some music, 
some avatars corresponding to different characters and more. The website users are all [characters](../characters) 
with their own dedicated pages.

We have a folder on our computer [FOR SOF](../for-sof/for-sof), 
which contains previously unlocked files, that we can also access through the [journal](journal). This journal 
was brought to us on the 4th of December 2024. It provides us with more insights into the files in this folder.

A brand-new [inventory](../for-sof/for-sof) feature was added during the December update. 
Files in this folder are protected by puzzles.

The music player on the website is called Noctune. It currently contains three versions of the song Wrist, 
but used to contain more. You can read more about it in the [article on website songs](website-songs).

Spyder is the in-universe [web browser](webbrowser) on the page and can be used to read several articles on 
the web.

{% include gallery.html folder="webpage/newbuttons" %}

The buttons on the new dashboard are virtually the same as the old ones, their main difference being their design 
and placement. They are now in the top right corner of the website.

There is also an `Emulator` button that looks like a controller in the middle of the page.
It leads to [ScreamStar](https://www.scream-star.com/).
