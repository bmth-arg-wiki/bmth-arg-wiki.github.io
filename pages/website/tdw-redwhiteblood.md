"Red, White, and Blood" is the title of a movie review posted on the Daily Whisper, which was accessed 
through the [webbrowser](webbrowser). It seems to be a parody of real world US politics, written by

> ### "Red, White, and Blood"
> 
> Movie Review by Lee M.D.
>
> ### Rating: 1/5 stars
>
> Jesus wept. They really don't make movies like they used to. But even by today's shoddy standards, Red, White, and Blood 
> takes us to new lows. This so-called political thriller is more like watching a high-stakes pub brawl between 
> two half-baked caricatures. Set in the Disunited Territories of Colombia (DTC), this **_flick_** stretches even the most slack-jawed 
> viewer's patience by asking us to believe that two of the most hopeless candidates alive could actually run for high **_office_**.
>
> The setup? Two walking wankers competing for the top spot in the DTC. On one side, we've got Ralph Beacon, 
> a doddering relic who's two winks away from a nap and thinks a press conference is prime nap time. His tagline, 
> Time to wake up couldn't be more on the nose. His advisors are more worried he'll have a stroke mid-sentence than anything 
> policy-related. Get to the biddy home, ya codger.
>
> Then there's Brock Thane, an ex-reality star and dodgy billionaire who's as subtle as a brick through a window. 
> This lad's criminal record's longer than his speeches, yet he somehow manages to rally the common folk from the comfort of 
> his private island. His slogans Make the DTC Great Again and Truth is Optional sound like the deranged mutterings of a 
> pub philosopher, and the **_film_** doesn't even have the decency to play them for laughs. Nope, 
> they're as serious as a heart attack.
> 
> The plot's as clunky as a 16-year-old's angsty DreamReel, lurching from campaign rallies to dodgy debates that unravel 
> like pub scraps. At one point, Thane dodges corruption charges by challenging Beacon to a gladiator-style showdown 
> because apparently, that's the logical next step in politics. Meanwhile, Beacon's team seems more focused on mopping 
> drool **_off_** his chin than on actual policies. The **_film's_** one redeeming quality is its relentless self-parody, 
> though that's likely unintentional.
> 
> And let's talk about the portrayal of us, the DTC's citizens. We're subjected to scenes of crowds cheering as Beacon 
> wanders **_off_** mid-speech, and mobs rallying around Thane after he claims his arrest was a media hoax cooked up by 
> leftist lizard people. The **_film_** practically screams, These are the leaders you deserve! It's cynical to the core, 
> **_offering_** no hope and even less wisdom.
>
> Midstream markets this wreck as a pulse-pounding journey into political intrigue. Right. 
> The only pulse I felt was checking to see if mine had **_flatlined_** from sheer boredom. Visually, 
> it's about as stimulating as a screensaver, and the soundtrack? Think a 5th-gen E-J cobbling together a dramatic score 
> out of 90s political ads and bagpipe solos.
