# Website Version 1.0

[POST HUMAN: NeX GEn](../music/ph-nex-gen) was released on the 24th of May 2024, along with the first version of the 
website. The page got a big makeover on the 4th of December 2024, resulting in the current [website](website).

### Old Overview & Password Screen

### Codek

This dialogue was shown briefly before getting a message that we needed to connect to the
internet first to use the messaging app. After connecting to the [wi-fi](wifi), we still
sadly could not access the codek, since M8 was updating and a firewall prevented us from accessing the
full capabilities of the wi-fi.

As of the December 4th 2024 update, the Codek tab has entirely disappeared.

### Access Card

This access card seemed to indicate who we were accessing the
[Multidimensional Navigator 8](../m8) as.
The access level was at level 2, only being at level 4 for a brief while after
the ARG first launched.

The card read as following:

> ACCESS CARD MS: M8 [illegible]-OK!
>
> NEX GEN presents [Dreamseeker variant] 2024 OST + A POST HUMAN STUDY (phase II)
>
> PATIENT 00029
>
> ACCESS LVL 2
>
> PH2222 0036
>
> Nex Gen (93)
>
> NG (symbol) MB (symbol) P.u.s.s-e (symbol)

The text below mentions something about two doses of [p.u.s.s.-e](../lore/pusse) a day and
going 'deeper'.

### Youtopia Stability Meter

The stability meter seemed to fluctuate slightly while you were visiting the page, not
changing all too much as of 31/05/2024.

### Weather Module

The weather as displayed before the 26th of May update. It was then
changed to the image below for a while and then displayed this card again.

![After weather update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/weather_update_26_05.png)

The weather as displayed after the 26th of May update for roughly 1-2 months.

### Buttons

{% include gallery.html folder="webpage/buttons" %}

The page also provided a button to manage your [Wi-fi](wifi), which will likely be needed to access the browser.
The Codek messaging app also stated that it needs a connection to the internet. The website button with M8 on it showed us some system information.

The last button in the row showed us what looks like system specifications, including the
serial number we used to access the webpage.

### Website Backgrounds

{% include gallery.html folder="webpage/gallery" %}

Before its big makeover, the website used to have a few wallpapers that you could rotate to your liking.
