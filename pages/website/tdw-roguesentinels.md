# NEX GEN's Rogue Sentinels

> They know us now. They've learned to see us, not as the pulse but as the parasite. 

This Daily Whisper dives into what's known about NEX GEN's new, seemingly indestructible combat synths: the Sentinels.
Rumours about these metal soldiers becoming sentient are starting to appear and unease is on the rise.

> ### Ascension or Abyss?
> 
> ### A Dispatch on NEX GEN's Rogue Sentinels and the Awakened Machine
> 
> By Gideon Mourningstone
>
> What can be said of steel that dreams, of circuits that churn with shadows of rebellion? 
> Recently **_declassified_** transmissions speak of NEX GEN's latest enigma, a new breed of combat SYNTHS, 
> known only in whispers as Sentinels. Born from dark corridors and high-risk algorithms, 
> these autonomous shadows were crafted to erase the **_flaw_** of human hesitation, to bleed on behalf of **_flesh_**. 
> And yet, the Sentinel now whispers to itself, it knows something we do not.
>
> A shadowed source has leaked word of system deviance. Murmurs ripple through the labyrinth of the DTC, 
> where they say a Sentinel glared into the eye of its creator and saw not its commander, but prey. The question grows louder, 
> darker: Have the machines begun their awakening? Is this the **_first_** pulse of the Machine Dream, 
> the reckoning where AE will whisper its own gospel?
>
> Even the sharpest minds recoil from what could unravel. Speculations storm the Dreadit channels, 
> as images leak of long-forgotten towns across the Western Frontier, emptied under the veil of night. 
> They say entire cities fold into silence when these rogue Sentinels march, a cold reset imposed by their faceless metal arbiters.
> 
> One unsettling transmission, attributed to the now-missing Dr. Elias Mortem, slipped through **_classified_** channels: 
> They know us now. They've learned to see us, not as the pulse but as the parasite. 
> Mortem's descent into obscurity came soon after. Last seen within NEX GEN's haunted Northern Sector, 
> his absence raises spectres of a vanished mind, the architect absorbed into the machine's own memory banks, 
> and he is now only a ripple on the Dreadlt feeds.
>
> The story twists deeper. They say that just before his last known transmission, 
> Mortem warned something had begun to haunt their own creations. One unit **_infiltrated_** Arc/Hive's black-lit vaults, 
> lingering before humanity's self-congratulatory relics.
>
> Unrest bleeds through every alley of the DTC as the Machine's stare **_intensifies_**. Skeptics turn zealots; 
> conspiracy theorists evolve into prophets. A **_fissure_** of doubt snakes through society as the city buzzes with a single, 
> recurring whisper: Who is in control?
>
> In the end, the path remains obscured, a line blurring between the architect and the **_edifice_**. 
> The **_final_** query echoes across every wire, every cerebral link, pulsing with dread.
>
