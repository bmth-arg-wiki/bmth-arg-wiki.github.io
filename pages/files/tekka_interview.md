> Meet Rebecca, the first of her kind. Jax Jackson goes under the hood... Rebecca, a former terminally ill lab assistant at Arc/Hive found herself thrust into the spotlight following her transformation via a cutting edge SYNTH trial. Diagnosed with a degenerative neurological condition from environmental toxins, Rebecca saw this experiment as her last hope. The SYNTH trial was a remarkable success, seamlessly transferring her conciousness into a synthetic body and greatly enhancing her capabilities. Overnight, she became a symbol of scientific breakthrough and hope. But with newfound fame came intense scrutiny.
>
> JAXON: Rebecca, you've become the face of NEX GEN, but isn't chain-smoking a bit pass√©? At the TEKKA press event, you were puffing away like it was 2025.
>
> REBECCA: (nervous laughter) Yeah, I actually don't like smoking at all. It was a marketing stunt by NEX GEN to showcase the invulnerability of SYNTH bodies. They thought it would make a strong visual impact. Now, it's just a habit, I guess.
>
> JAXON: Marketing, huh? So, you're basically a walking ad. Not exactly the terminally ill girl you used to be. How did it feel, living with a death sentence?
>
> REBECCA: It was... overwhelming. I had a degenerative neurological condition from environmental toxins. They told me I had months left. Every day was a struggle, knowing that my time was running out and there was nothing I could do about it.
>
> JAXON: And now? You‚Äôre practically invincible. Ever thought about going wild, maybe trying drugs, partying?
>
> REBECCA: (hesitates) That‚Äôs not really my thing. I wasn‚Äôt into that stuff before, and I don‚Äôt see a reason to start now. My focus is on my work. 
>
> JAXON: Come on, everyone needs to cut loose sometimes. Ever been to one of our legendary TEKKA parties? Trust me, they‚Äôre worth it.
> REBECCA: (smiles awkwardly) I‚Äôve heard stories. Maybe I‚Äôll attend one day, but I‚Äôm still adjusting to all this.
>
> JAXON: Speaking of work, you‚Äôve been promoted to managing the R&D team. Quite the leap from where you started. How‚Äôs that going?
>
> REBECCA: It‚Äôs been a steep learning curve, but I‚Äôm managing. The team is brilliant, and we‚Äôre making significant progress in several key areas.
>
> JAXON: Let‚Äôs talk about the big players here. What‚Äôs your take on Victor Carmine? Some say he‚Äôs a visionary, others say he‚Äôs a bit of a psycho.
>
> REBECCA: Victor is‚Ä¶ intense. He‚Äôs driven and has a clear vision for the future. He made some controversial decisions, but his dedication to advancing technology is undeniable.
>
> JAXON: And what about Dallus Lauren and Karl Strassman? Any juicy details on them?
>
> REBECCA: They‚Äôre both incredibly intelligent and committed to their work. I can‚Äôt really speak to their personal lives, though.
>
> JAXON: Come on, Rebecca. You must have heard something about the whole MANTRA debacle and Operation Trinity. What‚Äôs the real story there?
>
> REBECCA: (firmly) I can‚Äôt discuss that. My focus is on the present and our future projects.
>
> JAXON: Fair enough. But what about those rumors about extreme experiments and human suffering? What‚Äôs really going on behind the scenes?...
