> ## Blood Porridge
> Entry: January 14th 2027
>
> Hi cruel world,
It’s official. I’ve got the big C. CERS. Chronic Environmental Respiratory Syndrome. I knew it deep down when I started coughing up what looked like blood porridge ten months ago, but I kept hoping I was wrong.
>
> Terminal.
>
> Dr. Turner delivered the news so calmly, like he was discussing the weather. Actually, he was discussing the weather at one point, since that’s what messed me up so badly. He reckons I have about six months. Eight tops. Gosh. Typing that out makes it so much realer.
>
> I’ve always known the risks of living in this poor excuse for a planet. My work at ARC/HIVE is all about finding solutions to these problems, but I never thought I’d be one of the victims. I guess I thought it wouldn’t happen to me. How the flip has it happened to me? I see less daylight than a vampire. If I’m not in the lab, I’m at home watching Neko Paradise with Charlie and Darko. I know, super cool, right? I’m a crazy cat lady who listens to old-school metalcore and watched anime.
>
> Come to think of it, I’ve never even left the DTC, except when my family went across the border for my coding back in 2013. I used to dream of finding a boyfriend and together we’d get a 6-day tourist pass to new-Seoul. But nope, never happened.
>
> The truth is, while others were out experimenting life, making memories, and building friendships, I was buried in my books, immersed in my work. I’ve never drunk, never tried drugs, never even stayed out past midnight unless it was to finish a project. And now, it feels like all those sacrifices were for nothing.
>
> Iara is probably the closest thing I have to a friend, and she’s almost 20 years older than me. Maybe even more boring than I am, if that’s possible. That’s unfair since she’s the most neurodivergent person I have ever met, but she’s perfectly happy building her pseudo-spaceship, still waiting for the aliens to respond to that AI chatbot she made when she was 15 years old for ARC/HIVE. I love her, but she is a few years short of a gizmo.
>
> She has at least been laid, though. It may have been with Billy, who gives mouth breathers a bad name, but still, it’s more than I can say. I’m 27 years old and still a virgin. I’ve never even been kissed.
>
> Mom always wanted me to be a model, but I wanted to be a hacker. Can you believe it? I could have been strutting down a runway, instead I was knee-deep in algorithms and debugging. Looking back, maybe Mom had a point. I mean, here I am, terminally ill, and all I have to show for it are some awards for “Best Prototype” and the world’s largest collection of Youtooz.
>
> Mom and Dad don’t know yet. How do you tell your parents that their daughter is dying? They’ve always been so proud of my work, of my accomplishments, despite my mom’s occasional jabs that my apparent beauty was wasted on me. It’s going to kill them.
>
> And then there’s my work. What happens to all my projects? I’ve poured my heart and soul into ARC/HIVE. We’ve made so many breakthroughs, and there’s still so much left to do. Who will take over? Will they care as much as I do? It feels like my entire life has been a series of checkboxes, and now there’s a big, fat “X” next to the last one: “Live.”
>
> Dr. Turner mentioned some new experimental treatments, but they’re risky and unproven. I don’t want to spend the last few months I have hooked up to machines being pumped full of Vita or whatever, Not just to delay the inevitable?
>
> Iara did say that ARC/HIVE has been working on some revolutionary projects. It’s all very hush-hush, but she let slip that Dallus is on the cusp of something that could save mankind. Although nothing can reverse the cell damage that’s already been done in my body. I’m sick to the core. 
>
> For now, all I can do is take it one day at a time. Breathe in, breathe out. Write it down. Try to find some semblance of peace in this chaos. Maybe getting it out on this blog will help. Tbh, right now, I feel even worse than I did before. But still, at this point, it’s all I know.
>
> I need to start living. You know what? I might go to Cyberia tonight. Try and pull a hot guy, bring him back here, do… stuff. My mom thinks I’m beautiful, maybe someone else will. Ok. I’m doing it.
>
> (Edit) Just broke down trying to apply lipstick. I don’t even know how to apply lipstick. I’s dying. What the actual hex.
>
> I guess I’ll just watch the new “Meow Meow” and eat a bucket of ice cream. At least I can do that now guilt-free.
>
> I know there are only 96 of you, probably less after reading this grief vomit. But thanks. If you like to watch car crashes unfold in real-time, keep subscribing.
