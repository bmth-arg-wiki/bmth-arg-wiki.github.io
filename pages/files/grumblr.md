This file's name seems to be a play on Tumblr, just like [Dreaddit](dreadit) was a nod to Reddit.
It contains an entry from [Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) who has already been seen in [Tekka Magasine](tekka_interview).

> Hi cruel world,
It‚Äôs official. I‚Äôve got the big C. CERS. Chronic Environmental Respiratory Syndrome. I knew it 
> deep down when I started coughing up what looked like blood porridge ten months ago, but I kept 
> hoping I was wrong.
>
> Terminal.
>
> Dr. Turner delivered the news so calmly, like he was discussing the weather. Actually, he was 
> discussing the weather at one point, since that‚Äôs what messed me up so badly. He reckons 
> I have about six months. Eight tops. Gosh. Typing that out makes it so much realer.
>
> I‚Äôve always known the risks of living in this poor excuse for a planet. My work at ARC/HIVE 
> is all about finding solutions to these problems, but I never thought I‚Äôd be one of the victims. 
> I guess I thought it wouldn‚Äôt happen to me. How the flip has it happened to me? I see less daylight 
> than a vampire. If I‚Äôm not in the lab, I‚Äôm at home watching Neko Paradise with Charlie and Darko. 
> I know, super cool, right? I‚Äôm a crazy cat lady who listens to old-school metalcore and watched anime.
>
> Come to think of it, I‚Äôve never even left the DTC, except when my family went across the border for my 
> coding back in 2013. I used to dream of finding a boyfriend and together we‚Äôd get a 6-day tourist pass to 
> new-Seoul. But nope, never happened.
>
> The truth is, while others were out experimenting life, making memories, and building friendships, I was 
> buried in my books, immersed in my work. I‚Äôve never drunk, never tried drugs, never even stayed out past 
> midnight unless it was to finish a project. And now, it feels like all those sacrifices were for nothing.
>
> Iara is probably the closest thing I have to a friend, and she‚Äôs almost 20 years older than me. 
> Maybe even more boring than I am, if that‚Äôs possible. That‚Äôs unfair since she‚Äôs the most neurodivergent 
> person I have ever met, but she‚Äôs perfectly happy building her pseudo-spaceship, still waiting for the 
> aliens to respond to that AI chatbot she made when she was 15 years old for ARC/HIVE. I love her, but she 
> is a few years short of a gizmo.
>
> She has at least been laid, though. It may have been with Billy, who gives mouth breathers a bad name, 
> but still, it‚Äôs more than I can say. I‚Äôm 27 years old and still a virgin. I‚Äôve never even been kissed.
>
> Mom always wanted me to be a model, but I wanted to be a hacker. Can you believe it? I could have been 
> strutting down a runway, instead I was knee-deep in algorithms and debugging. Looking back, maybe Mom 
> had a point. I mean, here I am, terminally ill, and all I have to show for it are some awards for 
> ‚ÄúBest Prototype‚Äù and the world‚Äôs largest collection of Youtooz.
>
> Mom and Dad don‚Äôt know yet. How do you tell your parents that their daughter is dying? They‚Äôve always been 
> so proud of my work, of my accomplishments, despite my mom‚Äôs occasional jabs that my apparent beauty was 
> wasted on me. It‚Äôs going to kill them.
>
> And then there‚Äôs my work. What happens to all my projects? I‚Äôve poured my heart and soul into ARC/HIVE. 
> We‚Äôve made so many breakthroughs, and there‚Äôs still so much left to do. Who will take over? Will they care 
> as much as I do? It feels like my entire life has been a series of checkboxes, and now there‚Äôs a big, fat ‚ÄúX‚Äù next to the last one: ‚ÄúLive.‚Äù
>
> Dr. Turner mentioned some new experimental treatments, but they‚Äôre risky and unproven. I don‚Äôt want to 
> spend the last few months I have hooked up to machines being pumped full of Vita or whatever, Not just 
> to delay the inevitable?
>
> Iara did say that ARC/HIVE has been working on some revolutionary projects. It‚Äôs all very hush-hush, 
> but she let slip that Dallus is on the cusp of something that could save mankind. Although nothing can 
> reverse the cell damage that‚Äôs already been done in my body. I‚Äôm sick to the core. 
>
> For now, all I can do is take it one day at a time. Breathe in, breathe out. Write it down. 
> Try to find some semblance of peace in this chaos. Maybe getting it out on this blog will help. 
> Tbh, right now, I feel even worse than I did before. But still, at this point, it‚Äôs all I know.
>
> I need to start living. You know what? I might go to Cyberia tonight. Try and pull a hot guy, 
> bring him back here, do‚Ä¶ stuff. My mom thinks I‚Äôm beautiful, maybe someone else will. Ok. I‚Äôm doing it.
>
> (Edit) Just broke down trying to apply lipstick. I don‚Äôt even know how to apply lipstick. I‚Äôs dying. 
> What the actual hex.
>
> I guess I‚Äôll just watch the new ‚ÄúMeow Meow‚Äù and eat a bucket of ice cream. At least I can do that 
> now guilt-free.
>
> I know there are only 96 of you, probably less after reading this grief vomit. But thanks. If you like to watch
