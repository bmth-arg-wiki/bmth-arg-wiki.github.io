### Translated

> In the silence of the palace,
> A moonbeam shines through the windows,
> In secret I cry quietly...
>
> In the empty marble halls,
> Between shadows and whispers,
> My words are dangerous
>
> On the day when we met,
> the moonlight touched us
>
> Your smile is a star, your laughter is a bright ray,
> In the labyrinth of my dreams,
>
> You don't know me well,
>
> But I give you a sign, if you want to see me, find me on the street.
> Your gaze in the crowd, my heart cannot remember.
>
> Your image is my night light.
> Read my secret friend, in these verses love and mystery live.

Currently, very little is known about this file. It dropped along with 
[Skys & the Starjammers poster](skystarjammers) and the [Unbeleevable video](unbeleevable). 
It could be related to character [Skys](../characters/skys) due to the S on the 
letter, but nothing has been confirmed.
