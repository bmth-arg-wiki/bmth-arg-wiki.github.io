# Project D.U.S.T., P.S.Y & S.Y.K.O.

This file contains a research proposal from [ARC/HIVE](../music/amo-in-the-dark) 
for several projects. The initial proposal was finished or sent on the 15th of January 2021, 
then the document was declassified by Nex Gen exactly 10 years later.

## Speculation

The document speaks about "the special six", which may be the children we see in 
the official [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid) music video.
