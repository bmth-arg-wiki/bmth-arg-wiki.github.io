# Trinity members and Arc/Hive

This article discusses the role different trinity members could fill for [ARC/HIVE](../../lore/archive).

## Dallus Lauren

We know that he created the MOXYPAK and was involved in the creation of synths. In the "In the Dark" MV we also see several 
labs at Arc/Hive, including the plant corollary. Here is a guy with cables on his back and a plant with blue sharp-looking 
flowers. There is also an experiment room with Oli (which version?). Another lab has a printer that seems to print 
a continuous stream of data (so perhaps real-time data, measured from somewhere? perhaps biological markers?).

Then there is the altilium chordata tank, which puts the subject in metastasis, which should resemble a coma-like 
experience for the subject. Through neural interfacing, they could then gather data on the subject in the tank and 
possibly even send information directly to their brain. This could provide computing power, or 'batteries' for EVE. These 
tanks seems to be the precursor for the Dreamseeker, which is later developed at Nex Gen Corporation.

My interpretation is that he is a bioengineer who works with both biological matter and technological components. 
The Lauren D8 log states that Dallus saw a future where we could learn to live with the big environmental collapse that 
had already happened then (likely referring to WW3 and the nuclear fallout).
However, it also states that his current inventions were limited to the ultra-rich and wealthy and military usage. 
This military usage implies that Arc/Hive has strong ties to the government. This could explain why the DTC, which seems 
to be a government organisation was willing to extract the trinity in the interest of Arc/Hive (and by extension their own 
national security).

Project D.U.S.T was designed as a bioweapon. This does not fit Ikaro's description of his dad's character. If we believe 
Ikaro, Dallus may have been tricked into creating harmful weapons or technology. "In The Dark" shows Dallus dealing with 
a lot of guilt and possibly grief, potentially resulting from what he has done. We also see another version of him, obscured, 
stepping through a wall into his room several times.

TL;DR: Arc/Hive Corporation wanted Dallus as a bio-engineer, possibly to design the Altilium Chordata tanks as a precursor to the 
Dreamseeker tanks. Since they supply the military, the government was willing to extract him, Strassman and Skys from Novosovia in Operation 
Trinity.

## Karl Strassman

We know Karl ´Strassussy´ Strassman best from the codek file, where we learn that he is involved in experiments with 
P.U.S.S-E. He warns EVE of its dangers. However, Arc/Hive also had an interest in Strassman, indicating that he may have 
done some earlier research. Strassman seemingly is based on a real life counterpart with the same name, who is an expert 
on DMT, also called 'the spirit molecule'.

Karl Strassman may have worked on one or multiple drugs before PUSS-E. He was involved with the Neosages, also known as 
the cult of Mantra. Mantra was the drug the cultists seem to die to in the events of the Mantra music video. It is likely 
that the media came up with the name 'Cult of Mantra' as a result of this. Strassman was likely involved with the creation 
of Mantra the drug. There are merch items, physical releases and promotional images indicating that amo is a drug as well, 
but no references have been made to this. This may have been another of Strassman's inventions.

TL;DR: ARC/HIVE probably wanted Strassman to develop drugs.

## Skys

Skys is the charming face of the Neosages/Mantra cult. However, he does not seem to be the only one pulling the strings, 
as we see several scenes of what looks like a company getting involved. They display the logo on their flipchart and 
shots of Skys getting his hair cut. One woman in red occurs a lot, and she is also the person who finds Skys 
when he fakes his death. She seems mildly shocked at first, but seems to smirk right after. She is the one who gives 
the cultists Mantra and instructs them to take the pill. The intention seems to be to kill the cultists. However, Skys 
reveals himself to be alive. The cultist all die (by Skys?), including the woman in red (definitely Skys), who is very 
surprised by what is happening to her.

Skys is a very charming man obviously, something that is also mentioned in the UNBELEEVABLE video. He is the face, 
if not the mastermind, behind the Neosages/Mantra cult. He was also in a band called Skys & the Starjammers. Dr Lee MD (Madman?) 
was possibly in this band too, which would explain his insider knowledge. However, we are not sure if there is only one of 
each band member.
Arc/Hive likely wanted knowledge from Skys. Everyone also assumes he was dead. There are a few problems with Skys for 
Arc/Hive: his reputation may have gone down the drain, and people think he is dead. His charisma was a strong tool, but 
after faking his death and information about the Mantra cult spreading,
his reputation might be too damaged to put that to use.
He would likely have to change his name and still be useful for his powers.

TL;DR: Skys is charismatic (but likely known to be problematic and also dead),
has tons of useful knowledge, has special powers?
