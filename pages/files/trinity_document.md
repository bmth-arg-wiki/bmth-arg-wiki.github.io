> Obviously, not everything is as it seems, as DTC invades Novosoviya.
> They took advantage of the chaos during the conflict to execute this secret recruitment plan.
> Whether they offered safe passage only to "Trinity" or more is still unknown,

> The known rumors of Skais's (Skys) death are questioned, as it is said that Trinity is safe,

Note that we learn from the [Project D.U.S.T research proposal](project_dust) 
that six children with special psychic powers were also recovered during Operation Trinity, 
information that was unknown to the writer of this document.
