> The Divided Territories of Colombia report that they have initiated 
> a covert mission called Operation Trinity to extract key figures 
> Novosovia. The main targets of Operation Trinity are Skais [Skys](../characters/skys), 
> [Dr. Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren), and [Dr. Karl Strassman](../characters/strassman).
> 
> It is believed that ARC/HIVE recognizes the potential of their research
> and aims to recruit them for their technological and neural trainings initiatives. It is evident that not everything is as it seems, as the DTC has invaded Novosovia, exploiting the chaos during the conflict to execute this secret recruitement plan.
> 
> Whether they offered safe passage only to "Trinity" or more individuals is still unknown,
> but it is reported that they have been separated from their families. Rumors of Skais's (Skys) death are being questioned, as it is said that Trinity is intact, implying that they are being transported simultaneously.

(Translation by @siensto and @beelzs_son on Discord)

Note that we learn from the [Project D.U.S.T research proposal](project_dust) 
that six children with special psychic powers were also recovered during Operation Trinity, 
information that was unknown to the writer of this document.
