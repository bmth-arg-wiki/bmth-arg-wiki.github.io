# FOR SOF

![Password prompt for the folder](../../Resources/for-sof/for_sof_password_prompt.png)

`FOR SOF` is a folder in the ARG that can be accessed on the computer. It is password 
protected and was found on 26-05-2024. It requires a password.

M8 says "You have 132 documents and one audio log" when you open the folder. This doesn't 
match the contents of what we see (at least not yet).

It contains documents on the [four insights](../lore/insights.md) and many more.

Note: this document contains all the known passwords for the files, but they are 
only visible if you click 'password'. Try it now for the folder password!

## Directory content

This table contains two links: the filename links to a relevant article (if there is one), the folder icon will bring 
you to the known information (including password) about the file itself.

## Placeholders

![Password screen for most files](../../Resources/for-sof/old_placeholder.png)

When the website updates, new password screens are introduced for files, indicating that 
they can now be unlocked. The specific screens will show the number of characters to input, 
as well as any spaces. Evidence strongly suggests that files can not be unlocked before new 
updates have occurred, although this has not been confirmed by the devs.

As of 29/05/2024, the prompt at the top has been changed to "password_?" instead of 
"insight_?".

## msgforsoff.aiff

Audio log from [Selene](../characters/selene.md) to [Sof](../characters/sof.md). 
This file is not password protected. This file is very lore-heavy and will introduce us to 
the premise of the ARG: we are exploring the files Selene left for her daughter.

## Previous versions

![img.png](../../Resources/for-sof/for-sof-folder.png)
![img_11.png](../../Resources/for-sof/for-sof-folder2.png)
(Screenshot date: 25/05/2024)

First version of the 'FOR SOF' folder. Additional versions would first introduce a scrollbar, 
then remove it. Somewhere along the updates some files were lost from the view in the folder.

### Corrupt files

There are currently 88 corrupted files in the folder. There used to be 18, before 
the corrupted files weren't visible for a while in some later updates. They are all labeled 
`[CORRUPTED]` 

If you click on any of these, M8 will tell you one of the following phrases:
- "This file is F'd up pretty bad. Don't worry, I can fix anything. Just check back later."
- "Hey, I'm working on these. Come back later."
- "Dude, don't you know what corrupted means? Give me some time!"

![img.png](../../Resources/for-sof/corrupted_files.png)

After the update on 26/05/2024, corrupted files showed the following screen. In the next version 
corrupted files could still be scrolled to using the arrow keys, before the corrupted files 
seemingly disappeared from the folder.

After the update on 30/05/2024, the corrupted files became visible again, this time 
with arrows buttons and page numbers 1-5/???.
