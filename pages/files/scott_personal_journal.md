Scott’s Diary

October 28, 2037

Dear Diary,

I don’t know what’s going on, but something’s up. Feeling like actual; shit. Oskar won’t stop barking, and I’m pretty sure the TV is bust.
Seems like every channel is playing the same news story, it’s sending me insane. What’s even crazier-earlier, somebody bit me, BIT ME.

Ceto has always been a sketch head, but he’s clearly dipping way too much into his own stash now. I’m going to have to look for another hookup. I know, I know, I said I was clean. But it’s just Nexies. I would never have managed to handle all my extra ciric without them.

Between Advanced Neuro and Bio-DM, I was drowning. And his stuff is next level, like he was getting it straight from the source. No brain buzz, barely any twitch. But now I’ve got cold sweats, and my vision is starting to blur. 

Is the fallout kicking in already? Or did I catch something off that waster!? Surely not…I tried to clean the bite mark, but it keeps oozing this nasty, yellowish fluid…

What a fucking day.


October 29, 2037

Dear Diary,

I can’t believe I’m actually going to take a day off school. Haven’t missed one since 4th grade. I know that’s a pretty nerdy flex, but I don’t give a shit.

The world’s gonna know my name-even if it kills me. But..I gotta be real..there’s no way I can go. I’m fucked. I’m sure it’s just the fallout but I’m low key scared I’ve caught this flu this TV keeps banging on about.

I feel kinda itchy, kinda like there’s bugs under my skin. My reflection is so grey, my eyes are sunken, like, even more than usual.
My thoughts are all fuzzy…It’s like I’m forgetting who I am…Selene keeps coming to my mind…wish I could see her, but she can’t see me like this. Everything’s like a fever dream…

To make things worse, the dog’s gone rabid. Barking at me like he hates me. Wish he would shut the fuck up, he’s doing my head in. 
Fuck, how long have I been in my room? Where’s Mum? I’m fading in and out. Don’t know where I’ve been. I feel so hungry. When did I last eat? The itching is unbearable. I just scratched myself so hard I drew blood.

What the hell is happening?
