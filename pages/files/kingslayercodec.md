## The Puzzle

> ðŸ›ˆ This puzzle is very time-consuming, and the password screen only allows you 30 
> seconds to try a password after you click check.
> Keep the password ready!

![Solution to the wire puzzle](../../Resources/files/kingslayer_codek/puzzle.png)

The following is the solution to the maze. To solve it yourself, you will need to beat the 
timer and click and rotate the pieces.
The pieces are always in the same order, making the strategy below the most viable.

1. Start at the top, the green line will connect and show you what is correct
2. Leave the first piece alone, but note the number it displays
3. Click each blue piece until it displays the number of the previous wire. 
4. Click it once more and rotate it into place.
5. Repeat for each wire.

Tip: you will need to click once for the first wire you connect, twice for the second and this pattern 
continues until the end.
