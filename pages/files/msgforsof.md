## Audio transcript 

Adapted from Discord user @KKChamps

> Hi Sof. This is Selene. 
I’m your… I’m your mother. 
I’m recording this message while holding you, staring into your eyes, 
trying to contemplate how the hell I’m going to do this. 
Because even though you are the most beautiful creature I’ve ever seen, 
even though I gave birth to you less than 20 minutes ago, I have to leave you.
>
> Just saying those words destroys me more than you will ever know, and 
I never expect you to forgive me for this. 
But one day I hope you will be able to at least understand. 
>
> Ok. Where do I start? If you’re listening to this, it means you survived. 
And I guess it means you managed to decrypt M8, she’s a little bit crazy but trust her, 
she saved my life more times than I can remember. 
She has no doubt already done the same for you. 
>
> But more importantly, she holds the keys to unlocking the past that has been hidden from you, 
for good reason. Because if I told you everything now, best case, 
you simply wouldn’t understand. Worst case, it would fuck your head up so bad 
that you would never come back, and I need this to be your choice.
> You decide.
> If you want to go any further, if you want to know any more
Because unlocking these secrets will be difficult, but learning the truth will be harder. 
>
> [thunder]
> Shh, it’s ok, it can’t hurt you. I never believed in destiny, but now I see...
> your destiny. You will be the one leads us out of this darkness.
> But for that to happen, there’s something I must do. There’s somewhere I must go.
> And I want… 
>
> [alarm]
> Fuck. That’s my cue. 
>
> Remember Sof,
> [Selene whispers what I think is Sof’s name a few more times].
> You're not alone. Even though I’m far away, I'm always with you.
> Believe in yourself and you will find the way.
> I love you. I love you. I.. I’m sorry.
>
> [alarm still blaring, beep before recording ends]
