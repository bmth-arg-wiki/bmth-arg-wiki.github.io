# Dr. Lee MD

In the [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable) video, the doctor (played by Lee Malia) calls himself "Dr. Lee".
At this stage, we do not know if this is a separate character, or if [Madman](madman) is also Dr. Lee.

## Backstory

Dr. Lee MD is a content creator, starring on the Community Resource Analog Programming (CRAP) network. This network allows the 
public to create content, creating a mix of "harmless content and wild conspiracy" according to Susan White (from [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) PR) 
in [leak email about Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable). Usually this network is not seen as a threat, but Dr. Lee MD has 
made several accurate claims that suggest access to insider information.

He created the first episode around 2039, according to [Sof](sof)'s [journal](../lore/journal). According to Sof, he is an eccentric figure and 
his accent is not from the [DTC](../lore/dtc). She also remarks his current status is unknown and that Nex Gen may have silenced 
him. The first episode is not received well by Nex Gen. Susan's email suggests 
that they monitor the show, prepare a PR strategy and inform the FANTOM team. The FANTOM team is an internal operations 
team at Nex Gen, which may need to perform a "slate wipe", according to the email.

A second episode of [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) has Dr. Lee MD going more into the backstory of [Skys](skys), 
also mentioning a mysterious woman [Medea](medea) who tried to take down the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra) from the inside. 
The episode ends with Lee MD's need for a bowel evacuation (also CRAP). The outro segment shows Lee MD trying street 
drug [Lupamine](../lore/lupamine), a very dangerous drug that is causing an epidemic in the DTC and that is highly addictive.
