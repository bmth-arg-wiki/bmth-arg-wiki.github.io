# Dr. Lee MD

Dr. Lee MD is the charming host of [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable), a show on a Youtube-like platform 
called CRAP. He also writes for [The Daily Whisper](../website/website#the-daily-whisper), a news website that can 
be organised in the ARG itself through the browser.

Dr. Lee MD is, of course, played by Lee Malia. [Madman](madman) is also played by him, but it is unknown whether there is 
a connection here. In [Unbeleevable 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3) we also meet a man who claims to be Dr. Dee, who tells 
Lee that he is not who he thinks he is.

## Backstory

Dr. Lee MD is a content creator, starring on the Community Resource Analog Programming (CRAP) network. This network allows the 
public to create content, creating a mix of "harmless content and wild conspiracy" according to Susan White (from [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) PR) 
in [leak email about Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable). Usually this network is not seen as a threat, but Dr. Lee MD has 
made several accurate claims that suggest access to insider information. However, Lee successfully releases at least 
two more episodes of his show.

Apart from the show, Dr. Lee MD wrote at least three articles for a news website called "The Daily Whisper". He 
writes one [movie review](../website/tdw-redwhiteblood), as well as two articles about [synths](../lore/synths).

He created the first episode around 2039, according to [Sof](sof)'s [journal](../website/journal). 
According to Sof, he is an eccentric figure and his accent is not from the [DTC](../lore/dtc). She also remarks his current status is unknown and that Nex Gen may have silenced 
him. The first episode is not received well by Nex Gen. Susan's email suggests 
that they monitor the show, prepare a PR strategy and inform the FANTOM team. The FANTOM team is an internal operations 
team at Nex Gen, which may need to perform a "slate wipe", according to the email.

A second episode of [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) has Dr. Lee MD going more into the backstory of [Skys](skys), 
also mentioning a mysterious woman named [Medea](medea), who tried to take down the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra) from the inside. 
The episode ends with Lee MD's need for a bowel evacuation (also CRAP). The outro segment shows Lee MD trying street 
drug [Lupamine](../lore/lupamine), a very dangerous drug that is causing an epidemic in the DTC and that is highly addictive.

The third episode of Unbeleevable expands on Skys' and Medea's story, revealing that she was sent in by [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine), 
who also happens to be her father. The episode ends with a man named Dr. Dee storming in, claiming that Lee is not 
who he thinks he is.
