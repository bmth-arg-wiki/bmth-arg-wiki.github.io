# Characters

The following page contains an overview of the most relevant characters to the Post Human world. 
They are grouped into smaller sections to make the relationships between them and their placement 
on the timeline clearer.

***

## Selene, Sof and M8

[Selene](selene) and [Sof](sof) are the protagonists of our story, according to the [lore booklet](../lore/booklet). 
The story centers on Selene's story, her own history and how she had to leave her baby Sof roughly 20 minutes 
after giving birth. The story of the ARG also started with this moment, in the [message for sof](../for-sof/msgforsof). 
She left Sof in the care of [M8](../m8), an AI assistant made by [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).

[Sof](sof) is a non-binary demi-god who is discovering her past through the files 
we uncover in the ARG, left by their mom Selene. Sof also seems to be our point-of-view, with their [journal](../website/journal) 
also being a separate app on the [website](../website/website).

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/selene, /pages/characters/sof, /pages/m8' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

***

## Mantra Cult

The story mostly focuses on the misdeeds of Nex Gen Corporation, which trace back to the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra). 
Using knowledge from their [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer), the company eventually continues the cult's 
work after its fall in 2020. The Mantra era of the story starts roughly around 2004.

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/skys, /pages/characters/strassman, /pages/characters/dallus-lauren, /pages/characters/medea, /pages/characters/alfgram, /pages/characters/ava' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

After [Operation Trinity](../lore/operation-trinity), Dallus confirms that [Ava](ava) is dead and her and Strassman's child 
Angel is missing. [Medea](medea) is attacked by Skys in the music video for [MANTRA](../music/amo-mantra). [Victor Carmine's reconstructed 
interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview) confirms that her head exploded, and she too died.

From the [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable) episodes, hosted by Dr. Lee MD, we learn a lot about the Mantra 
cult as well, but little about its corporate off-shoot: [the church of Genxsis](../lore/church).

***

### Arc/Hive & Nex Gen

The company central to the ARG, [Nex Gen Corporation](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), was once known as [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive).
[Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) tries to erase the Cradle Crash, an incident that brought down Arc/Hive, by 
re-branding the company to Nex Gen. A bloody family legacy results in Victor inheriting the company. Victor and 
[Elias Mortem](elias-mortem) start [Project D.U.S.T.](../lore/incident-dust) together, continuing what Skys started 
with Project Kingslayer.

[Eve](eve) is finalised by [Ren](ren) in 2037, shortly before the [VSPR-37](../lore/vspr37) pandemic. At some point, 
Eve takes over Nex Gen, becoming the head of the corporation. In 2039, we see Eve working with Strassman to reach 
[Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) in the [Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec). They are using [Selene](selene)'s 
unique biology for this, synthesizing it into [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse).

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/victor-carmine, /pages/characters/elias-mortem, /pages/characters/eve, /pages/characters/ren, /pages/characters/rebecca, /pages/characters/iara' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

Other mentions include Nex Gen's FANTOM Team (mentioned in [email about Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable), 
[Sof's journal](../website/journal) and possibly [Kingslayer Codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec)). The email about Unbeleevable 
is sent from Susan White (PR Department) to a Dr. R Fletcher.

The name "Emily" also seems related to Nex Gen directly. This name was rank 9 out of 10 ranks (with 10 being highest) 
to appear for a Discord event centered around the [church of Genxsis](../lore/church). E.V.E is ranked 8th, implying 
that Emily is even more powerful within Genxsis than Eve. The name has not appeared since the event.

## Youtopia Residents

{% include content/info.html
title="Interactive Map!"
content="Please also check out our interactive version of [Selene's map](../map)."
%}

[Youtopia](../lore/youtopia), or dimension Y-93, is a utopian dimension. It can be reached through spiritual 
enlightenment, but Nex Gen Corporation is researching methods to help people achieve Youtopia. The [lore booklet](../lore/booklet) 
is the biggest source of knowledge for this dimension. [M8](../m8) is also able to transmit grainy footage from Youtopia.

### The Archangels

The archangels are guardians of [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) and all have their own [insights](../lore/insights).

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/raphael, /pages/characters/gabriel, /pages/characters/michael, /pages/characters/uriel' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

Angels can also be found in the [spectrograms](../music/spectrograms) in
[(spi)ritual](../music/song-spiritual), which also mentions all of their names in a ritual similar to the
Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, which comes from Thelema in the real world.

We learn more about these angels in the [deluxe album game booklet](../lore/booklet).
Their relation to the insights is also mentioned: [Raphael](raphael) is the angel of [connection](../lore/insight1-connection),
Gabriel of [empathy](../lore/insight2-empathy), Michael of [purpose](../lore/insight3-purpose)
and [Uriel](uriel) to [vision](../lore/insight4-vision).

### Omens

The following characters are omens of the [insights](../lore/insights):

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/pan, /pages/characters/miseria, /pages/characters/vanth, /pages/characters/babylon' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

Most of the information we have about them comes from the [booklet](../lore/booklet). They are also mentioned in the
[insights document](../lore/insights). [Pan](pan) relates to [connection](../lore/insight1-connection),
[Miseria](miseria) to [empathy](../lore/insight2-empathy), [Vanth](vanth) to [purpose](../lore/insight3-purpose)
and [the Babylon](babylon) to [vision](../lore/insight4-vision).

### Band Members

The Bring Me The Horizon band members all appear in the world of Post Human. Oliver Sykes is [Syko](syko),
Matt Kean is [Vegan](vegan), Lee Malia is [Madman](madman) and Mat Nicholls appears as [Pickles](pickles). Little
is known about them, but they are mentioned in the [lore booklet](../lore/booklet).

[Dr. Lee MD](lee-md) is another character played by Lee Malia, although the link between Madman and Dr. Lee is currently
unknown.

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/syko, /pages/characters/vegan, /pages/characters/madman, /pages/characters/pickles' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

![Band member profile pictures.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/socials/band_member_profiles.png)

We can find the evidence for this in the band's own instagram, where all of their profile pictures were changed to
correspond to the system users. Different ID numbers have been used for the band members, with the current ID numbers on the
website being number 004 through 007 (Syko, Vegan, Madman, Pickles).

![Band cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/band-cards.png)

A promotional image of the band on cards also links them to the [four insights](../lore/insights). Syko is linked
to [connection](../lore/insight1-connection), Madman to [empathy](../lore/insight2-empathy), Pickles to [purpose](../lore/insight3-purpose)
and Vegan to [vision](../lore/insight4-vision).
