# Characters

The following page contains a categorization of the characters in the ARG. It will help you get an overview of the most 
important names and how the characters relate to each other.

***

## System Users

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/eve, /pages/characters/vegan, /pages/characters/uriel, /pages/characters/selene, /pages/characters/raphael, /pages/characters/syko, /pages/m8, /pages/characters/pan, /pages/characters/miseria, /pages/characters/michael, /pages/characters/pickles, /pages/characters/madman, /pages/characters/strassman, /pages/characters/ren, /pages/characters/iara, /pages/characters/gabriel, /pages/characters/vanth' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

***

## Other Characters

Additionally, there are characters not listed on M8. For example because they were 
mentioned in documents.

These are:

| Character                            | Source                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Sof](sof)                           | Many                                                                            |
| [Angeldust](angeldust)               | Mentioned in live shows                                                         |
| [Dr. Elias Mortem](#dr-elias-mortem) | Mentioned in [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust)                        |
| [Emily](#emily)                      | Mentioned in the BMTH Discord                                                   |
| [Rebecca](rebecca)                   | [Sof's journal](../lore/journal), [Tekka interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview) |
| [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine)     | [Sof's journal](../lore/journal), [Tekka interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview) |

### Sof

[Sof](sof) is one of our protagonists, discovering their origins from the files her mother [Selene](selene) left when they 
abandoned them. We see Sof in many sources and get to read their [journal](../lore/journal), which explains their take on the files.

### Victor Carmine

Victor Carmine is a mysterious man mentioned in the [Tekka Interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview). Jax Jackson,
the interviewer from Tekka mentions that he is a "big player" and that some call him a visionary, others call
him a psycho. Sof's journal explains that he is the big boss at Nex Gen and was also the boss when the company was still
called ARC/HIVE.

### Dr. Elias Mortem

Dr. Elias Mortem was the lead scientist at Arc/Hive Research Division at the time of
declassification of the [Project D.U.S.T. research proposal](../for-sof/project_dust). He was later slaughtered
along with his team at the [Chapel incident](../for-sof/chapel).

### Rebecca

Rebecca was a terminally ill lab assistant at Arc/Hive, before becoming the first
synth. She is [interviewed](../for-sof/tekka_interview) about the ambitious project from Nex Gen
by a magazine called Tekka.

### Angeldust

Angeldust is shown on stage during [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid).

### Emily

The name "Emily" is rank 9 out of 10 ranks to appear for a Discord event centered around the 
[church of Genxsis](../lore/church). E.V.E is ranked 8th, implying that Emily is somehow above her in the ranks of Genxsis.


***

## Categorisations

The system numbers can be confusing, but we can still group some of our 
characters to understand them better.

### The Archangels

The archangels are guardians of [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) and all have their own [insights](../lore/insights).

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/raphael, /pages/characters/gabriel, /pages/characters/michael, /pages/characters/uriel' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

![Spectrogram showing four angel-like figures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/spectrograms/spectrogram-archangels.png)

Angels can also be found in the [spectrograms](../music/spectrograms) in
[(spi)ritual](../music/song-spiritual). We learn more about these angels in the [deluxe album game booklet](../lore/booklet).

***

### Omens

The following characters are omens of the [insights](../lore/insights):

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/pan, /pages/characters/miseria, /pages/characters/vanth, /pages/characters/babylon' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

Uriel's insight is [Vision](../lore/insight4-vision), which has the omen [the Babylon](babylon), which is not one of the 
system users. The babylon is depicted as a three-headed snake in the [deluxe album booklet](../lore/booklet).

Pan's user number is 0009, Miseria's is 0010 and Vanth's is 0018. Pan might also 
play a role in [Night of Pan](../lore/night-of-pan) ritual. The Babylon does not have a user, and its appearance was only recently revealed on the [booklet](../lore/booklet).

***

### Band Members

The following characters correspond to the members:

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/syko, /pages/characters/vegan, /pages/characters/madman, /pages/characters/pickles' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

![Band member profile pictures.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/socials/band_member_profiles.png)

We can find the evidence for this in the band's own instagram, where all of their profile pictures were changed to 
correspond to the system users. Sykes/Syko is 0005, Kean/Vegan is 0001, Malia/Madman is 0012 and Nicholls/Pickles is 0011.

![Band cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/band-cards.png)

A promotional image of the band on cards also links them to the [four insights](../lore/insights).

***

### The Trinity

The members of the Trinity are three people of interest, mentioned first in the [trinity document](../for-sof/trinity_document). 
[Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) ordered their extraction from Novosovia.

{% assign page_links = '/pages/characters/strassman, /pages/characters/skys, /pages/characters/dallus-lauren' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

The first member is [Dr. Karl Strassman](strassman), a doctor that works with [Eve](eve), as 
evidenced by the [strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec). He is user 0014 on the [webpage](../webpage).

The second member is cult leader [Skys](skys), who we see in the music video for [Mantra](../music/amo-mantra). Some 
imagery related to Mantra also appears in the music video for [Sugar, Honey, Ice and Tea](../music/amo-shit).

The last member is Dallas Lauren, who was the head of R&D at Arc/Hive (see [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust)). 
He passed away before 2037, as evidenced by the [D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log) from his son 
[Ikaro (Ren) Lauren](ren). Dallas Lauren also invented the MOXYPAK and possibly synths, according to the 
same log. The project D.U.S.T. file explains that he suffers from mares, despite a desensitization protocol. 
He is depicted in the music video for [In The Dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) by Forest Whitaker, possibly 
experiencing the desensitization protocol. This video also contains (a second version of) the altilium chordata 
tank we see in the project D.U.S.T. file.
