# Dallus Lauren

Dallus Lauren, also referred to as 'Dallas Lauren' in the [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable) 
video, is one of [the Trinity](../characters#trinity).
According to the [D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log), he died in or before 2037.

## Backstory

> The MOXYPAK was revolutionary, a personal air purification device that transforms CO2 into breathable oxygen using BioCores. Still widely used, even if considered rudimentary now.
And the Synthetic Neurological Transference Human Project – systems designed to house human consciousness, enhancing cognitive functions and augmenting intellectual capacities.
My father envisioned a future where these would mitigate the environmental collapse, though they’re currently limited to military use and the ultra-wealthy.

### Dallus & Mantra

On the fateful day of [19th of December 2004](../for-sof/skystarjammers) Dallus first gets involved with unethical human 
experimentation at October Palace. From [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) we learn that on this day, he had come along 
with [Strassman](strassman), who was deeply intrigued by the ramblings of [Mantra](../lore/mantra) cult leader [Skys](skys). Although Dallus was 
hesitant at first, him and their assistant Ro came along to meet him at the Skys & the Starjammers soirée.
On this night, while much debauchery was going on, Dallus intended to leave when Skys did something to their assistant Ro. 
Both Dallus and Lauren decided to stay and push the boundaries of neurospiritual science.

However, the cult of Mantra (also known as the Neosages) eventually fell in an event also named the October Massacre, also 
at October Palace in Novosovia. Dallus and [Elena](elena-lauren) fled from Novosovia with their son Ren, while Elena went 
into labour. [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) was very interested in the scientist and his companions, leading boss [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) 
to order their extraction in an operation nicknamed [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document). 
Dallus and his family were extracted in time for their youngest, [Lyra](lyra-lauren), to be born in the safety of ARC/HIVE's lab. 
Shortly after, he writes his [diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) and [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) is first proposed.
From the research proposal we learn that Dallus is undergoing desensitization protocols for his [mares](../lore/mares), 
which he likely got as a result of Skys and his cult. More concerning is the fact that his daughter Lyra, born at ARC/HIVE 
and not exposed to the cult, is also seeing and drawing mares. This suggests that the mares may have been transferred genetically.

### The Car Crash

On November 5th 2024, Dallus visits the [Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper) theme park, a park known for its technological innovations. 
While he is driving home with his children Ren and Lyra in routine traffic, he gets into an accident that his daughter 
Lyra does not survive. Officials ruled that Dallus had made an error while driving, but rumors persisted that something 
in the park had caused the incident. It is also unclear where Dallus' wife Elena is at the time of the accident, as she 
seems to vanish from records after their escape from Novosovia.

### Working with Rebecca

In November 2036 he starts working with [Rebecca](rebecca) on the SYNTH ("Synthetic Neurological Transference Human Project") 
project. From her [Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2) we also learn that his youngest, Lyra, tragically passed away in a 
car crash. Dallus himself seems hollow, according to her, like he is only half there. Rebecca was the first successful 
synth after suffering from a terminal illness, thanks to Dallus' invention. From his son's log we also learn that he worked 
on the MOXYPAK, "a personal air purification device that transforms CO2 into breathable oxygen using BioCores".

### Death & Ikaro's Legacy

Dallus Lauren's son was named [Ikaro Lauren](ren), a trans man who is referred to as Dallus' daughter in his father's diary, 
but prefers to call himself Ren. Like his father, he works with ARC/HIVE, now known as [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). 
He develops a series of AI assistants, the RO8OTs, following in his father's footsteps. In the year 2037 we learn from Ren that his father 
has tragically passed away, in [E.V.E.'s genesis log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log).

The [trinity document](../for-sof/trinity_document) shows us that Dallus in the man we see 
in the music video for [In the Dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark), played by Forest Whitaker.
