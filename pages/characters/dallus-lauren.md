# Dallus Lauren

Dallus Lauren, also referred to as 'Dallas Lauren' in the [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable) 
video, is one of the Trinity, powerful men within the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra), later 
ending up as an employee at [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive).

Dallus' death is a very significant turning point for the story. During an incident called "The Cradle Crash", an incident 
occurred where Dallus went "catatonic", according to [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine)'s assistant. Carmine 
then convinces [Ikaro Lauren](ren) to continue his father's work.

## Backstory

> The MOXYPAK was revolutionary, a personal air purification device that transforms CO2 into breathable oxygen using BioCores. Still widely used, even if considered rudimentary now.
And the Synthetic Neurological Transference Human Project – systems designed to house human consciousness, enhancing cognitive functions and augmenting intellectual capacities.
My father envisioned a future where these would mitigate the environmental collapse, though they’re currently limited to military use and the ultra-wealthy.

The [Trinity document](../for-sof/trinity_document) shows us that Dallus in the man we see
in the music video for [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark), played by Forest Whitaker. It is unknown when exactly
this event takes place, but we seem to see Skys as a [synth](../lore/synths) here, placing it after 2026 and before his death.

### Dallus & Mantra

On the fateful day of [19th of December 2004](../for-sof/skystarjammers) Dallus first gets involved with unethical human 
experimentation at October Palace. From [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) we learn that on this day, he had come along 
with [Strassman](strassman), who was deeply intrigued by the ramblings of [Mantra](../lore/mantra) cult leader [Skys](skys). 
Although Dallus was hesitant at first, him and their assistant Ro came along to meet him at the Skys & the Starjammers soirée.
On this night, while much debauchery was going on, Dallus intended to leave when Skys did something to their assistant Ro. 
Both Dallus and Lauren decided to stay and push the boundaries of neurospiritual science.

Skys' torture escalated with the start of [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer) in 2015. A message from Skys 
recruiting the youth of [Novosovia](../lore/novosovia) reached [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) in the [DTC](../lore/dtc) instead. 
According to [Unbeleevable episode 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3), this eventually caused Dallus to snap.

However, the cult of Mantra (also known as the Neosages) actually falls somewhat later in an event also named the October Massacre,  
at October Palace in Novosovia. Dallus and [Elena](elena-lauren) flee from Novosovia with their son Ren, while Elena goes 
into labour. [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) was very interested in the scientist and his companions, leading boss [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) 
to order their extraction in an operation nicknamed [Operation Trinity](../lore/operation-trinity).

Dallus and his family were extracted in time for their youngest, [Lyra](lyra-lauren), to be born in the safety of ARC/HIVE's lab. 
Shortly after, he writes his [diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) and [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) is first proposed.
From the research proposal we learn that Dallus is undergoing desensitization protocols for his [mares](../lore/mares), 
which he likely got as a result of Skys and his cult. More concerning is the fact that his daughter Lyra, born at ARC/HIVE 
and not exposed to the cult, is also seeing and drawing mares. This suggests that the occurrence of mares may have a genetic component.

### The Car Crash

On November 5th 2024, Dallus visits the [Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper) theme park, a park known for its technological innovations. 
While he is driving home with his children Ren and Lyra in routine traffic, he gets into an accident that his daughter 
Lyra does not survive. Officials ruled that Dallus had made an error while driving, but rumors persisted that something 
in the park had caused the incident. It is also unclear where Dallus' wife Elena is at the time of the accident, as she 
seems to vanish from records after their escape from Novosovia.

### Working with Rebecca

In November 2027 he starts working with [Rebecca](rebecca) on the SYNTH ("Synthetic Neurological Transference Human Project") 
project. From her [Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2) we also learn that his youngest, Lyra, tragically passed away in a 
car crash. Dallus himself seems hollow, according to her, like he is only half there. Rebecca was the first successful 
synth after suffering from a terminal illness, thanks to Dallus' invention. In this file, we learn that Skys may actually 
have been the first synth. From his [son's log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log) we also learn that he worked 
on the MOXYPAK, "a personal air purification device that transforms CO2 into breathable oxygen using BioCores".

### Death & Ikaro's Legacy

> "Years later, something big happened.
> Arc/Hive rebranded to NEX GEN, and Dallus is died, with evidence suggesting grim-play.
> EVE, an advanced research engine was activated, and VSPR-37,
> a virus that turned people into voidlings (zombie-like creatures),
> began spreading, all within a few days."
> 
> - [Sof](sof) in their [journal](../website/journal)

Dallus' death is suspicious and unclear, but directly resulted from an incident called "The Cradle Crash" that 
also caused ARC/HIVE to rebrand as Nex Gen. When Victor Carmine is interrupted during his 
[interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview) by his assistant, she reveals that 
Dallus has gone catatonic and his son Ren has been continuing his work. Dallus had been working on [E.V.E.](../characters/eve) 
before his death, by decoding blueprints sent to them by aliens. The aliens from planet HIP contacted them through an 
AI chatbot named ADAM, which was created by Dallus' colleague [Iara Copple](iara) in the early 2000s.

The incident that caused his death is also mentioned in the [LBR sites letter](../for-sof/lbr_sites) sent by Strassman. 
He writes about the construction of new Lesser Banishing Ritual sites, a ritual he also explores in his 
[research with Selene](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc). The letter explains that forces collided with Dallus' 
consciousness, which resulted in this state. It is speculated that we see this event in [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark).
