Syko is user 0005 in the Multidimensional Navigator 8.

He is the stand-in character for Oliver Sykes, BMTH's lead singer.
Syko is related to the First Insight: [connection](../lore/insight1-connection), 
alongside Archangel [Raphael](raphael) and Omen [Pan](pan).

## Backstory

Syko, otherwise knows as "nosferatu" in the [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn booklet](../lore/booklet), 
is unpredictable, enigmatic, and bold. He has an affinity for adventure,
which he approaches head-on with a keen intellect and resilience.

> - Scott in his [diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal)

Currently, we only have [Scott's Diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal) for Syko's experiences. 
His user number is the password for this file, and Oliver's second name in real life is Scott. 
We know that he is 16 in 2037, putting his date of birth somewhere in 2020 or 2021, after the 
[fall of Mantra](../for-sof/unbeleevable).
In his diary, he gets infected with VSPR-37.
However, it is unknown what happens to him after the infection takes over his body and decision making (as 
evidenced in the diary).

> *It 3:16. Mouth taste like corpse….wait..sum1 knocking on my door…no…it cant be…That face…that tasty face…Tasty…itchy…*

The diary ends with someone knocking at his door. [Selene](selene) is a likely candidate, as she mentions 
that she will check on Scott in her own diary.
The last line is also a reference to Resident Evil and the whole diary uses lots of lyrics from [Dear Diary](../music/song-dear-diary).
