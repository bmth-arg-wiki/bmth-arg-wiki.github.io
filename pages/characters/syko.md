## Backstory

Syko, otherwise knows as "nosferatu" in the [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn booklet](../lore/booklet), 
is unpredictable, enigmatic, and bold. He has an affinity for adventure,
which he approaches head-on with a keen intellect and resilience.

## Scott (Old identity?)

content="This next section is entirely based on speculation. None of it is confirmed.
The theory pointing towards Scott and Syko being the same person stems from the fact that the password
for Scott's Diary is Syko's user number. "Scott" also happens to be Oli's real-life middle name. "

### Overview

Scott is [Selene](selene)'s friend.
They're in the same school and are the same age.

### VSPR-37 Infection

Scott's contamination is documented day by day in [his diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal).
Most of the words are lyrics from the POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR song [Dear Diary,](../music/song-dear-diary).

**October 28th 2037**:
Scott talks about something being wrong, having cold sweats and blurry vision.
He then says that he got bit: "What’s even crazier-earlier, somebody bit me, BIT ME." 
He adds that his dog [Oskar](#gallery) keeps barking.

**October 29th 2037**:
The next day, Scott feels so awful that he misses school for the first time since fourth grade.
Like Selene, he mentions everyone talking about this "flu" on TV. 
He's scared that it's what he caught. He feels itchy and looks like a corpse. 
Oskar has gone rabid.

**October 30th 2037**:
Scott can barely write and makes a lot of typos.
He wants to see Selene but is scared of what he'd do to her: 
"Need meet… fresh… Selen… mis u. 
wan to see her 1 last time, but scare of wat i do. 
her face is only thing that stil mek sense. her tasty face…"

**October 31st 2037**:
Oskar's gone quiet because Scott ate his face.
At 3:16pm, someone knocks at his front door.
From what he writes ("That face…that tasty face…"), we understand that the person is Selene,
who talked about visiting him that day in [her diary](../for-sof/selene_personal_journal).

### Death
