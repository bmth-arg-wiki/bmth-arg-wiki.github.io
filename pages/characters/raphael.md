# Raphael

![Raphael's avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/raphael/4raphael.png)

Raphael is one of the archangels and is linked to [Insight 1: Connection](../lore/insight1-connection).

Currently, he is user 0004 and 0007 in the system. It is unknown why this duplication 
occurs.

Raphael used to have three different user IDs: 0004, 0007 and 0008 (see [gallery](#gallery).
After the June 4th 2024 update user 0008 has seemingly
disappeared, causing other characters to have 1 subtracted from their user number.
With this update, we went from 18
to 17 profiles.
The image for user 0007 used to actually be [Uriel](uriel).
