# Raphael

![Raphael's avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/raphael/4raphael.png)

Raphael is users 0004 and 0007 in the Multidimensional Navigator 8.

He is related to the First Insight: [Connection](../lore/insight1-connection), 
alongside Omen [Pan](pan) and band member [Syko](syko).

The symbol for 'Connection' is visible on his top in the [tour poster](#gallery).

Before the June 4th 2024 update, Raphael used to be users 0004, 0007, and 0008. 
This update removed his 0008 profile and subsequently brought down all the 0009 to 0018 users down a number.
There is now a total of 18 profiles, fromm 0000 to 0017.

Additionally, the picture for user 0007 used to be [Uriel](uriel)'s picture.
