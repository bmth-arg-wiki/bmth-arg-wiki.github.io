Previous avatar pictures. Raphael used to have three different user ID's: 0004, 0007 and 0008. After the June 4th 2024 update user 0008 has seemingly
disappeared, causing other characters to have 1 subtracted from their user number. With this update, we went from 18
to 17 profiles.
The image for user 0007 is actually [Uriel](uriel).
