# Dr. Elias Mortem

Dr. Elias Mortem was the lead scientist on [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive), 
continuing his work after the company rebrands to [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). He was later slaughtered 
with his team in the [Chapel Incident](../for-sof/chapel).

## Backstory

Dr. Elias Mortem is one of the senders of the [Project D.U.S.T. research proposal](../for-sof/project_dust), also 
known as Deaths Unknown Spiritual Terrain. Just like [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine), he was very interested in the 
research of the Trinity in the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra). [Skys](skys) believed that hurting people
physically and psychologically was the key to reaching enlightenment. Skys himself had mysterious powers, some if he 
learned after he fell in with a group practicing Velama. Through his project Kingslayer, he tortured people to near-death, 
to help them unlock an ancient power. When the cult fell, the members of the cult were somehow able to fend off 
hundreds of troops. [Dr. Karl Strassman](strassman) and [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren) were also working with him at the time. 

Carmine ordered the extraction of these three men from Novosovia, where the October Palace was located. Elias Mortem wanted 
to know more about the exceptional powers, which seemed to use dark matter for the cult's gain. The shared visions the 
cult was able to produce, colloquially referred to as [mares](../lore/mares), paralysed the soldiers with fear. Mortem 
was particularly interested in the use of mares for military applications. He was also interested in the abilities of the 
Special Six, which might be the kids we see in the [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid) music video.

The proposal also mentions a drug named Psychoactive Structured Yttrium (P.S.Y.), which seemingly impacts the abilities of its 
subjects. The Special Six children are able to fight off their captors using their exceptional abilities, which seem either 
natural to them or brought on by (a substance similar to) P.S.Y.

He is mentioned in the reconstructed 2037 interview with Victor Carmine, where the journalist accuses the men of 
performing sadistic rituals and sacrificing innocent lives.

[Sof](sof) tells us more about what happened to the man in their [journal](../website/journal.md), where they speculate that 
Project D.U.S.T. may have resulted in the Chapel incident, where Mortem and his entire team ended up slaughtered.
