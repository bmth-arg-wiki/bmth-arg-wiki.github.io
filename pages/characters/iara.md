## Backstory

![Iara seen in the Codek messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/message_screenshot.png)

Most of what we learn about Iara comes from [Rebecca](rebecca) in her Grumblr post and the [lore booklet](../lore/booklet). 
Rebecca mentions that Iara is likely neurodivergent. Iara made an AI chatbot for Arc/Hive in the mid to late nineties 
to chat with aliens, when she was only 15 years old. 

At the time of the Grumblr post on 14-01-2027, Rebecca is 27, putting her birthdate in 2000 (if her birthday is before
the 14th of January) or in 1999 (if she is yet to turn 28). She mentions that Iara is nearly 20 years older, giving us
a range of about 16-19 years older, depending on how dramatic Rebecca is being. This means Iara was likely born in the
range of 1980 to 1984. This puts the chatbot she made at 15 years old somewhere between 1995-1999.

### ADAM

Rebecca jokes that the aliens never got back to her, but the [booklet](../lore/booklet) tells us that the aliens
did (eventually) get the message. Iara also tells Rebecca she is building a pseudo-spaceship.

From [E.V.E.](eve)'s story in the booklet, we learn that the aliens were involved in her creation too, with the 
intention to intervene if humanity went too far with Artificial Intelligence. The booklet seems to imply that Iara 
was partially responsible for this due to her creation.

### Personal life

Iara also "got laid" at least once according to Rebecca, dating 
Billy, a man who is also briefly mentioned during the live shows, in the line "THEY GOT BILLY".
