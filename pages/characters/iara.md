Iara is a [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) employee, interested in aliens and a close friend of 
[Rebecca](rebecca). She is user 012 on the current version of the [webpage](../website/website).

## Backstory

![Iara seen in the Codek messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/message_screenshot.png)

Most of what we learn about Iara comes from [Rebecca](rebecca) in her Grumblr post and the [lore booklet](../lore/booklet). 
Rebecca mentions that Iara is likely neurodivergent. Iara made an AI chatbot for Arc/Hive in the early 2000s 
to chat with aliens, when she was only 15 years old.

The first [Grumblr](../for-sof/grumblr) post has slightly different timing. At the time of the post on 14-01-2027, Rebecca is 27, 
putting her birthdate in 2000 (if her birthday is before the 14th of January) or in 1999 (if she is yet to turn 28). 
She mentions that Iara is nearly 20 years older. If Iara is 16 to 19 years older, this would put her year of birth in the range 
of 1980 to 1984. This places the chatbot between 1995-1999. However, it is possible that Rebecca is exaggerating how 
old Iara really is in this post.

Before her chatbot, the [DTC](../lore/dtc) (where Arc/Hive is situated) and [Novosovia](../lore/novosovia)
once attempted contact with aliens in 1962, only receiving a faint signal back in 1983. Novosovia and the DTC had long been
in Cold War 2.0, before the signal in 1983 escalated the situation by convincing Novosovians the signal was a hoax.

Rebecca jokes that the aliens never got back to Iara, but the [booklet](../lore/booklet) tells us that the aliens
did (eventually) get the message. Iara also tells Rebecca she is building a pseudo-spaceship. In 2037, her boss 
at the company now known as [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), lies to an interviewer about making contact with aliens 
too.

From [E.V.E.](eve)'s story in the booklet, we learn that the aliens were involved in her creation too, with the 
intention to intervene if humanity went too far with Artificial Intelligence. The booklet seems to imply that Iara 
was partially responsible for this due to her creation.

### Personal life

Iara also "got laid" at least once according to Rebecca, dating 
Billy, a man who is also briefly mentioned during the live shows, in the line "THEY GOT BILLY".
