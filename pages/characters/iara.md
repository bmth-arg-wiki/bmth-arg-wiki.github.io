## Backstory

![Iara seen in the Codek messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/webpage/message_screenshot.png)

Most of what we learn about Iara comes from [Rebecca](rebecca) in her Grumblr post. She mentions that Iara is likely 
neurodivergent. Iara made an AI chatbot for ARC/HIVE in the mid to late nineties to chat with aliens, when she was only 15 years old. 

At the time of the Grumblr post on 14-01-2027, Rebecca is 27, putting her birthdate in 2000 (if her birthday is before
the 14th of January) or in 1999 (if she is yet to turn 28). She mentions that Iara is nearly 20 years older, giving us
a range of about 16-19 years older, depending on how dramatic Rebecca is being. This means Iara was likely born in the
range of 1980 to 1984. This puts the chatbot she made at 15 years old somewhere between 1995-1999.

Rebecca jokes that the aliens never got back to her, but they may have actually gotten the message, since they sent [E.V.E.](eve) 
to earth, according to the [booklet](../lore/booklet). She also "got laid" at least once according to Rebecca, dating 
Billy, a man who is also briefly mentioned during the live shows, in the line "THEY GOT BILLY".

Iara is also building a pseudo-spaceship, according to Iara. Iara is also confirmed to be still be working at the 
company after it becomes Nex Gen, through her key card on promotional materials.
