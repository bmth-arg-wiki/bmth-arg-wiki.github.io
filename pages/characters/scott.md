# Scott

Scott is [Selene](selene)'s friend. They're in the same school and are the same age. 
He is also referred to as NYX-02 in the [Kingslayer codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec), where he also 
seems to meet his end. [Sof's journal](../lore/journal) refers to him as deceased, after he is executed after a 
VSPR-37 infection, turning him into a voidling.

## Backstory

Scott's contamination is documented day by day in [his diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal).
Most of the words are lyrics from the POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR song [Dear Diary,](../music/song-dear-diary).

**October 28th 2037**:
Scott talks about something being wrong, having cold sweats and blurry vision.
He then says that he got bit: "What’s even crazier-earlier, somebody bit me, BIT ME."
He adds that his dog Oskar keeps barking.

**October 29th 2037**:
The next day, Scott feels so awful that he misses school for the first time since fourth grade.
Like Selene, he mentions everyone talking about this "flu" on TV.
He's scared that it's what he caught. He feels itchy and looks like a corpse.
Oskar has gone rabid.

**October 30th 2037**:
Scott can barely write and makes a lot of typos.
He wants to see Selene but is scared of what he'd do to her:
"Need meet… fresh… Selen… mis u.
wan to see her 1 last time, but scare of wat i do.
her face is only thing that stil mek sense. her tasty face…"

**October 31st 2037**:
Oskar's gone quiet because Scott ate his face. At 3:16pm, someone knocks at his front door.

As we suspect, it is Selene at his door, as we learn in the [Kingslayer codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec). 
Scott bites her after being transformed into a voidling due to his VSPR-37 infection, being executed by the FANTOM 
team shortly after.
