# Medea

Medea is the mysterious woman from the [MANTRA](../music/amo-mantra) music video. From [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) 
we learn that she was in the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra) to take it down from the inside.

## Backstory

Medea was first introduced to us in the official music video for MANTRA. During the music video, she appears in several 
corporate scenes. This corporation seems concerned with the image of [Skys](skys) and the cult, working on Skys' hair and presenting 
the Mantra logo.

She seems to have special access privileges within the cult, being the first to find Skys after he seemingly overdoses 
on the drug Mantra. Her face also seems to display something other than grief. From [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) 
we know that Medea was trying to take the cult down from the inside.

The video shows Medea at his funeral after, dressed in red, in stark contrast with the rest of the cult members who 
are dressed in neutral lighter colours. She supplies all the attendees with a pill, which they take at the same time. 
The cult members start touching their bodies, with Medea looking on anxiously, until she and the cult members begin 
to convulse violently. They are all hit by lightning and fall down and the video ends with Medea's head exploding.
