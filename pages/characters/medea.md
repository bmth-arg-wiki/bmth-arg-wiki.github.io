# Medea Carmine

Medea is the mysterious woman from the [MANTRA](../music/amo-mantra) music video. From [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) 
we learn that she was in the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra) to take it down from the inside. 

In episode 3 we learn more about her role. The transmission on the [website](../website/website) leads us to a partial 
reconstruction of a conversation with [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine). The interview, conducted by an unknown journalist, 
exposes Carmine's past and that he is her father. The interview reveals that Medea is an alias, leaving her real first 
name unknown.

## Backstory

Medea was first introduced to us in the official music video for MANTRA. She was revealed to be a double agent 
in the [cult of Mantra](../lore/mantra) by [Dr. Lee MD](lee-md).

### Mantra Infiltration

From [Unbeleevable 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3) and an interview with her father [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) 
we learn more about her involvement in Mantra. Medea was this woman's code name, and she was sent in as a secret agent 
on behalf of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive) from the [DTC](../lore/dtc). She was given instructions to seduce Skys and 
gain access to his secrets. However, she ended up falling for Skys, who was also in love with her. The two are known to 
have at least two children together. Skys is also confirmed to have many more children, although exact numbers are not given.

### Fall of Mantra

Medea is the first to find Skys after he seemingly overdoses on the drug Mantra. Her face also seems to display 
something other than grief.

The music video for MANTRA shows Medea at his funeral after, dressed in red, in stark contrast with the rest of the cult members who 
are dressed in neutral lighter colours. She supplies all the attendees with a pill, which they take at the same time. 
The cult members start touching their bodies, with Medea looking on anxiously, until she and the cult members begin 
to convulse violently. They are all hit by lightning and fall down, and the video ends with Medea's head exploding.

The interview with Victor Carmine confirms her fate, something which troubles him deeply. She dies before Operation Trinity 
and the fate of her and Skys' children remains unknown.
