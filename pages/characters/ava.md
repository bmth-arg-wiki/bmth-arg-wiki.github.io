# Ava

> Ava’s calm confidence and otherworldly beauty were magnetic.
> For Strassman, it was love at first sight (big mistake)

Ava is one of [Skys](skys)' disciples in the [cult of Mantra](../lore/mantra). She fills an important 
role in the cult, but ends up secretly falling for [Strassman](strassman).

## Background

In [Unbeleevable 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2) we first learn about a beautiful woman named Ava. She is described 
as one of Skys' "lady friends". [Strassman](strassman) and [Lauren](dallus-lauren) visit the cult in 2004 
at the [Skys & the Starjammers](../for-sof/skystarjammers) soirèe. When Strassman sees Ava, he immediately falls in 
love with her.

In [Unbeleevable 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3) we learn that Ava and Strassman have started a relationship, which 
Skys does not know about. The [Russian Poem](../for-sof/russianpoem) is confirmed to be a letter from Strassman to Ava. 

Unbeleevable 3 also depicts Ava as pregnant, somewhere after 2015, but before the fall of the cult. She expresses concern 
to Strassman after a traitor is revealed in the cult, with Skys torturing the man both as a test subject and a warning 
to the other cult members. Since Strassman and Ava betrayed Skys with their affair, the consequences for them could be 
just as severe.
