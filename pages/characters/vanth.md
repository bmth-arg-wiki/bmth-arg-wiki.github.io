# Vanth

![Vanth's Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/vanth/17vanth.png)

Vanth was user 0018 in the system and is user 0017 as of the 4th of June 2024. 
They are the Omen of [Insight 3: Purpose](../lore/insight3-purpose). In the documents, Vanth is referred to as a princess 
in the [Purpose](../lore/insight3-purpose) document. Both the map and the [deluxe album booklet](../lore/booklet) refer 
to Vanth as 'prince' instead.

## Backstory

In the [insights](../lore/insights) files, we see the omens [Pan](pan), [Miseria](miseria) and the Babylon on 
[Selene's map](../for-sof#YOUTOPIA_selenes_mapvis), but instead of 'Vanth: Princess of Death' in
we see '**Prince of Death**' in the South region of the map. Vanth's gender has not been confirmed.
