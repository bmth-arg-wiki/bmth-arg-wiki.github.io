Madman is Lee Malia's stand-in character in the universe for the band. Before the June 4th 2024 
update he was number 0013 in the system, he is now user 0012. It is unsure whether this character is related to 
Dr. Lee MD in the [Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable) video, who is also depicted by Lee Malia, lead guitarist 
of the band.

The insight associated with Madman is [empathy](../lore/insight2-empathy), an association he shares with [Miseria](miseria) 
and [Gabriel](gabriel).
