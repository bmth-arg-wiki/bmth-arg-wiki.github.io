is 015.

## Backstory

![Pan on Selene's map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/lore/insights/connection/raphael-selenes-map.png)

Marked on [Selene's](selene) map in the East as "a beautiful mistake". Currently, we do not 
have more context for this information.

> It is here that Pan, a playful yet dangerous Omen resides, playing a haunting melody on his Flute that 
> lures in all who hear it, forcing them to understand that Connection sta*r*ts with themselves.

There is not much known on Pan's backstory, but there are strong real-life parallels to the 
God [Pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)). 

There have also been some social media posts about the [Night of Pan](../lore/night-of-pan).

## Website History

Before June 4th 2024, his number was 0009 in the system, becoming 0008 for the remainder of time the 
first version of the website was up. His skin tone also changed during an update in June, giving his
light skin tone a pinkish hue.

The older avatar can be seen in the [gallery](#gallery).

***

## Speculation

Possibly related to [Night of Pan](../lore/night-of-pan). His skin 
tone is also the only character's we've seen that matches [Sof](sof), indicating 
that he might be her father or otherwise related.
