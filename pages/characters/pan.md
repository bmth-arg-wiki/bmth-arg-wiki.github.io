# Pan

![Pan's avatar after turning pink](../../Resources/characters/pan/pink_pan.png)

Omen of [Insight 1: Connection](../lore/insight1-connection). Before June 4th 2024, his number was 0009 in the system. 
It is currently 0008. His skin tone also changed during a later update in June, giving his 
light skin tone a pinkish hue.

## Backstory

![Pan on Selene's map](../../Resources/lore/insights/connection/raphael-selenes-map.png)

Marked on [Selene's](selene) map as "a beautiful mistake". Currently we do not 
have more context for this information.

***

## Speculation

Possibly related to [Night of Pan](../lore/night-of-pan). His skin 
tone is also the only character's we've seen that matches [Sof](sof), indicating 
that he might be her father or otherwise related.
