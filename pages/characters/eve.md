# E.V.E

![Eve's Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/eve/0eve.png)

E.V.E. (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment) is user 0000.

She is also known as E.V.E/L, which stands for Extremely Violent Ersatz Lifeform. M8 refers to her as the "big boss" in her WHO ARE YOU? speech.
She also implies that E.V.E. is on earth while we are not.

## Backstory

### Genesis

E.V.E's exact origins are currently unknown. The [Lauren D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log) 
does seem to indicate that E.V.E. gained sentience in 2037, showing remarkable capabilities 
far outside what Ren expected her to be capable of.

Since we see many different versions of E.V.E, including at the real world live shows, it is currently 
unclear whether this was the first version.

The [Grumblr](../for-sof/grumblr) post also talks about an AI chatbot [Iara](iara) created, a 
possible predecessor or primitive version of E.V.E.

### Intentions

E.V.E. often slips up in her wording, often speaking about controlling humanity then 
promptly correcting herself into saying she wants to save it.
It is certain that she has evil intentions, as we can see in the [Genesis Storyline](../lore/genesis-storyline) 
Oli wrote for [Downloadfest](../lore/downloadfest):

> E.V.E (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment) E.V.E/L (Extremely Violent Ersatz Lifeform) is a
state of the art advanced A.I research engine. She is the super computer which was
called upon by humans to save them from their own extinction. E.V.E is a highly intelligent
learning system which was built for the NEX GEN scientific study program. She is a highly
intelligent learning computer and calculated human interference and shut down when radical
mutations were born throu NEX GEN. E.V.E would not be deterred from its original goal and
believed that the mutations were positive progress towards evolution. However E.V.E
became aware that she would need the support of humans to keep its power systems
constantly active.

The same can be concluded from many live performances, where Oli instructs the fans to not listen to E.V.E. 
and [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).

### Current Goals

As mentioned above, E.V.E. is at the head of [Nex Gen Corporation](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). She is also heavily affiliated with
the [Church of Genxsis](../lore/church).

Her goal is to get hers and [Strassman](./strassman)'s subjects into 
[Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) using the revolutionary drug named [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse). 

While Strassman is very concerned about the effects of the [study](../lore/nex-gen-corporation#nex-gen-study) 
on its subjects, E.V.E brushes them off as necessary sacrifices needed for a better future. 
Both of them are researching [Selene](selene), the immune child mentioned in the Dreadit post. 
This was confirmed by a [message from E.V.E.](../socials/eve-discord) on Discord.
Due to her unique physiology, she produces extraordinary amounts of DMT (which P.U.S.S-E is based on), and they are 
therefore interested in her pineal gland.
They speak about "synthesizing her unique indole alkaloid structure" in the [Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec).
