# E.V.E 

![Eve's Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/eve/0eve.png)

E.V.E. (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment) is user 0000 in the Multidimensional Navigator 8. 

She is also known as E.V.E/L, which stands for Extremely Violent Ersatz Lifeform. M8 refers to her as the "big boss" in her WHO ARE YOU? speech.
She also implies that E.V.E. is on earth at the moment while we are not.

## Backstory

### Genesis

The [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn booklet](../lore/booklet#EVE) tells us that E.V.E. was originally created by an advanced alien civilisation as a precaution if humanity ignored warnings about dangerous sentient technology.
She was completed by [Ikaro Lauren](ren) as explained in the [Lauren D8 Log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log).

Since we see many different versions of E.V.E, including at the real world live shows, it is unclear if she went through multiple iterations of if she dimply just has different looks.

### Intentions

E.V.E has no plans to save humanity and Earth a better place. 
She has her own ambitions for survival and doesn't hesitate to use science as a weapon against the world's population.
She is cold-hearted and manipulative.

Although trying to appear kind on the outside, she often slips up and mentions wanting to control humanity.

This is hinted at by the [Genesis Storyline](../lore/genesis-storyline) Oli wrote for [Downloadfest](../lore/downloadfest), 
and further proven by many live performances where he incites crowds to distrust her and [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).

> E.V.E (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment) E.V.E/L (Extremely Violent Ersatz Lifeform) is a
state of the art advanced A.I research engine. She is the super computer which was
called upon by humans to save them from their own extinction. E.V.E is a highly intelligent
learning system which was built for the NEX GEN scientific study program. She is a highly
intelligent learning computer and calculated human interference and shut down when radical
mutations were born throu NEX GEN. E.V.E would not be deterred from its original goal and
believed that the mutations were positive progress towards evolution. However E.V.E
became aware that she would need the support of humans to keep its power systems
constantly active."

## Current Goals

As mentioned above, E.V.E. is at the head of [Nex Gen Corporation](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). She is also heavily affiliated with
the [Church of Genxsis](../lore/church).

Her goal is to get hers and [Strassman](./strassman)'s subjects into [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) using a revolutionary drug named [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse). 
While Strassman is concerned about the effects of the [study](../lore/nex-gen-corporation)on its subjects, 
E.V.E brushes them off as necessary sacrifices needed for a better future. 

Both of them are researching on [Selene](selene), the immune child mentioned in the [Dreaddit post](../for-sof/dreadit),
which was confirmed by a [message from E.V.E.](../socials/eve-discord) on Discord.
Due to her unique physiology, Selene produces extraordinary amounts of DMT (which is used to create P.U.S.S-E).
Therefore, E.V.E. and Strassman are acutely interested in her pineal gland.
They talk about "synthesizing her unique indole alkaloid structure" in the [Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec).
