# E.V.E 

![Eve's Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/eve/0eve.png)

E.V.E. (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment) is user 001 in the system on the newest version of the website.
She is also known as E.V.E/L, which stands for Extremely Violent Ersatz Lifeform. [M8](../m8) refers to her as the "big boss" in 
her WHO ARE YOU? speech on the [webpage](../website/website). [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) was the boss before Eve, but 
replaced by her some time after she was finished in 2037 by [Ikaro Lauren](ren).

## Backstory

The [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn booklet](../lore/booklet#EVE) tells us that E.V.E.'s technology was originally created by an 
advanced alien civilisation as a precaution if humanity ignored warnings about dangerous sentient technology. 

This technology seemingly ended up at [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), where [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren) 
started a project to have her save humanity. Due to his untimely death, his son Ren ends up activating E.V.E. in 2037.

### Alien Contact

According to [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine)in his [reconstructed interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview), 
[Novosovia](../lore/novosovia) and the [DTC](../lore/dtc) attempted to contact aliens during their Cold War 2.0 in 1962. 
Much later in 1983, they received a faint signal back. Novosovia thought it was a hoax and Carmine himself entered the war, 
sustaining serious injuries. 
In the early 2000s, child prodigy [Iara Copple](iara) was 15 when she developed ADAM: a chatbot designed 
to communicate with aliens for [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive). She succeeds in her mission, but the world is convinced 
of the opposite. Carmine also lies in his interview that ADAM never successfully made contact.

### Genesis

Eve was completed by [Ikaro (Ren) Lauren](ren) in 2037 as explained in the [Lauren D8 Log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log). Before 
that, she was Dallus' project. The log explains that Dallus has sadly passed away, something E.V.E. 
immediately senses in Ren. She uses quantum technology to reach Artificial Intelligence like never seen before, showing 
understanding of human emotion and motivation. Due to her unique technology, she is able to use empathy in her decisions. 
Ren is quickly convinced by her abilities, vowing to convince the board that she will be able to make decisions that can 
save humanity and the tarnished reputation of Arc/Hive.

### Youtopia Research

The first steps towards reaching [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) are taken in 2038, when [research into the Lesser Banishing 
Ritual of the Pentagram](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc) helps [Selene](selene) reach Youtopia. Nex Gen showed interest in 
Selene after being discovered immune to the [VSPR-37](../lore/vspr37) pandemic after [Scott](scott) bites her.

While E.V.E. claims to have humanity's best interests in mind, the [2039 Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec) 
has [Strassman](strassman) questioning her intentions. While they have been able to synthesise Selene's unique 
indole alkaloid structures into a drug named [P.U.S.S.-E](../lore/pusse), the initial lab results have been worrying. 
E.V.E. remarks that they will have to make sacrifices and that invoking Youtopia is still in the best interest of humanity. 
Strassman then accuses her of using the test subjects as batteries.

### Profile

E.V.E. has her own ambitions for survival and doesn't hesitate to use science as a weapon against the world's population.
She is cold-hearted and manipulative. Although trying to appear kind on the outside, she often slips up and mentions wanting 
to control humanity in material on social media.
