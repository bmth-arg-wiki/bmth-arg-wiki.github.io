# E.V.E 

![Eve's Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/eve/0eve.png)

E.V.E. (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment) is user 001 in the system on the newest version of the website.
She is also known as E.V.E/L, which stands for Extremely Violent Ersatz Lifeform. M8 refers to her as the "big boss" in 
her WHO ARE YOU? speech on the [webpage](../website/website). She also implies that E.V.E. is on earth at the moment while we are not.

## Backstory

The [POST HUMAN: NeX GEn booklet](../lore/booklet#EVE) tells us that E.V.E. was originally created by an advanced alien 
civilisation as a precaution if humanity ignored warnings about dangerous sentient technology.
She was completed by [Ikaro Lauren](ren) in 2037 as explained in the [Lauren D8 Log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log). 
Ikaro Lauren at the time is suffering the loss of his father [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren), something E.V.E. seems to 
recognize.

The first steps towards reaching [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) are taken in 2038, when [research into the Lesser Banishing 
Ritual of the Pentagram](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc) helps [Selene](selene) reach Youtopia. Nex Gen showed interest in 
Selene after being discovered immune to the [VSPR-37](../lore/vspr37) pandemic after [Scott](scott) bites her.

While E.V.E. claims to have humanity's best interests in mind, the [2039 Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec) 
has [Strassman](strassman) questioning her intentions. While they have been able to synthesize Selene's unique 
indole alkaloid structures into a drug named [P.U.S.S.-E](../lore/pusse), the initial lab results have been worrying. 
E.V.E. remarks that they will have to make sacrifices and that invoking Youtopia is still in the best interest of humanity. 
Strassman then accuses her of using the test subjects as batteries.

E.V.E. has her own ambitions for survival and doesn't hesitate to use science as a weapon against the world's population.
She is cold-hearted and manipulative. Although trying to appear kind on the outside, she often slips up and mentions wanting 
to control humanity in material on social media.

Within the ARG [website](../website/website), [M8](../m8) informs us that E.V.E. is the big boss at Nex Gen Corporation, a role 
also attributed to [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine).
