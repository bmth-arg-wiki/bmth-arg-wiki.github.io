# Elena Lauren

Elena Lauren is [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren)'s wife and a mother to [Ren](ren) and [Lyra](lyra-lauren). 
We do not know what she looks like yet, although she is likely to share traits with son Ren.

## Backstory

Elena fled from [Novosovia](../lore/novosovia) with her husband Dallus and son Ren, while going into labour with Lyra. Her husband 
Dallus was involved with the [Cult of Mantra](../lore/mantra) before that. There is no information available about her own 
involvement with the cult. 

The fall of Mantra happened around Christmas 2020, when [Operation Trinity](../lore/operation-trinity) 
was carried out. [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) managed to recover the Lauren family, allowing Elena to safely give 
birth to Lyra in their lab. We learn most of this from her husband in [his diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary). 
In Project D.U.S.T. we learn that their child Lyra, despite being born outside of Mantra, is exhibiting signs of 
[mares](../lore/mares).

The picture Rebecca paints for the Laurens in [her 2036 Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2) is bleak. We learn that 
Lyra has passed away in a car crash and that Dallus is not in a good mental state. We sadly do not know what happened to Elena, 
with [Sof](sof) even stating in her [journal](../website/journal.md) that Elena seems to fade from records after the escape.

In the [Gat3keeper article](../website/tdw-gatekeeper), we learn that Dallus was alone with the children on the day of the car crash 
in 2024, with no mention of Elena.
