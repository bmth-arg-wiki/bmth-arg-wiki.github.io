## Backstory

Ren's full name is Lauren Ikaro, being born to [Elena](elena-lauren) and [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren). At a young age, 
Ren and his parents fled from the remnants of the [Cult of Mantra](../lore/mantra), while his mother Elena went 
into labour with his sister [Lyra](lyra-lauren). Due to [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) being interested in his father's 
research with cult leader [Skys](skys), they end up being extracted during [Operation Trinity](../for-sof) around Christmas 2020.
In January 2021, Dallus writes in his diary that the whole family is at the ARC/HIVE laboratory. He also mentions that 
Ren is envisioning a whole line of RO8OTs: a line of AI assistants.

Tragedy strikes the family on the 5th of November 2024, when Dallus is driving Ren and Lyra home from the [Gat3keeper 
theme park](../lore/tdw-gatekeeper). A car crash occurs and Ren loses his sister Lyra a few months before her 4th birthday. 
According to official sources, the crash was a result of driver error. Rumors from the public blame the park, reasoning that 
it somehow influenced the event of that day.

In 2037, Ren is a scientist at the company, now named [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), 
as evidenced by [his log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log). In this log, he activates [E.V.E.](eve), 
an AI that shows remarkable capabilities, far exceeding initial expectations. This day is also the first day 
his robot D8 is at work, just like he envisioned in early january 2021.

In the log he also reminisces about his father [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren), who passed away before he 
could activate E.V.E. Him and his father are likely named after the Greek mythological duo Daedalus and Icarus.

In the [website song](../music/website-songs) "nmez!" we also see Ren listed as a producer.
