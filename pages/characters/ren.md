Ren used to be user 0015 in the system. He is user 0014 since the 4th of June 2024. 
His skin tone drastically changed in an update in June, at the same time as [Pan](pan)'s 
skin colour changing to a pinkish hue.

Ren's full name is Lauren Ikaro, and he is a scientist at [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), 
as evidenced by [his log](../files/lauren_d8_log). In this log, he activates E.V.E., 
who shows remarkable capabilities, far exceeding initial expectations. He also reminiscisces 
about his father [Dallus Lauren](characters#dallus-lauren), who passed away before he 
could activate E.V.E.
