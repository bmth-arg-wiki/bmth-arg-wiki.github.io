## Backstory

Ren's full name is Lauren Ikaro, and he is a scientist at [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), 
as evidenced by [his log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log). In this log, he activates E.V.E., 
who shows remarkable capabilities, far exceeding initial expectations. He also reminiscisces 
about his father [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren), who passed away before he 
could activate E.V.E.

In the [website song](../music/website-songs) "nmez!" we also see Ren listed as a producer.
