# Rebecca Sinclair

Rebecca was a former terminally ill lab assistant at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive), before becoming the first
synth. She is one of many characters living in the [DTC](../lore/dtc). She is [interviewed](../for-sof/tekka_interview)
about [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation)'s [SYNTH](../lore/synths) project after becoming the first synthetic human.
Sadly, she later falls victim to [Lupamine](../lore/lupamine) addiction.

## Backstory

Rebecca's story starts tragically with a terminal diagnosis in her [2027 Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr). 
She suffers from CERS, or Chronic Environmental Respiratory Syndrome. She remarks that she is 27 years old, 
still a virgin and mostly spends time at her own house around her cats. She speaks about her bond with her 
quirky coworker [Iara](iara) and how her diagnosis affects her. We learn that [Dallus](dallus-lauren) is working on 
something that could save her, but she is already experiencing neurological symptoms and struggling to put on lipstick.
At the time of her illness, she works at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) as a lab assistant. 

### Working on Synths

Later that year on November 5th we hear from Rebecca on [Grumblr](../for-sof/grumblr2) again. She writes about her day, 
working with Strassman and Dallus on the SYNTH project for the first time. Unexpectedly, she learns that [Skys](skys)
is not only still alive, but Strassman and Dallus plan to transfer his consciousness into a synth. Skys, not so happy
to awake as a synth, starts begging the three scientists for death. While Strassman and Dallus argue about the state of him,
Rebecca states that she will "do it". It is unknown what happens to Skys after, as the post ends with a cryptic "I'll do it". 
It's never explicitly stated if she is already a synth in this article. She is called the first synth later, but this post 
opens up the possibility that she was not.

### Synth body

In the [2028 Tekka interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview) we learn that things seem to have improved for Rebecca. 
In the eyes of the public, she had become the first [synth](../lore/synths) in a successful project that 
the company credited to [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), a name ARC/HIVE now also seems to operate under. 
Nex Gen is so confident in the resilience of their Synthetic Neurological Transference Human (synth), they have her smoke 
as a marketing ploy.
Rebecca also made a promotion to head of R&D (Research & Development). Interviewer Jax Jackson asks her about working with 
Dallus, [Strassman](strassman) and [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine), but she shuts the interviewer down.

### Lupamine

From unlocking the credentials for the [Spyder](../website/webbrowser), we get access to several articles from the Daily Whisper. 
One of the articles details that sadly, Rebecca had fallen victim to a [lupamine](../lore/lupamine) addiction, becoming 
violent and psychotic. It was thought that synths were immune to addiction, but the drugs effects were even amplified 
by her synthetic body. She became the most infamous case of Lupamine addiction. The addictive nature of Lupamine stems from the 
so-called loopholes, which cause erratic behaviour and a craving for the drug.
