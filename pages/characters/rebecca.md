# Rebecca Sinclair

Rebecca was a former terminally ill lab assistant at Arc/Hive, before becoming the first
synth. She is [interviewed](../files/tekka_interview) about the ambitious project from Nex Gen
by a magazine called Tekka.

We learn more about Rebecca and her diagnosis in the [Grumblr file](../files/grumblr). 
She suffers from CERS, or Chronic Environmental Respiratory Syndrome.
This disease has already caused her so much damage she likely won't be able to be saved by 
[Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren)'s research.
Nex Gen then saves her life by turning her into the first synth.
She smokes as a marketing ploy.
