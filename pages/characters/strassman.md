![Karl Strassman's avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/strassman/13strassman.png)

Dr. Karl Strassman is (or was) a scientist at [Nex Gen Corporation](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). The company 
extracted him in [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document) when the company was still known as [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive). 
The company was mostly interested in him due to his involvement with the [Cult of Mantra](../lore/mantra). The company 
was determined to use the anomalies observed there as powerful national security weapons.

Early in the ARG, we learn that he helped [E.V.E](../characters/eve) gain control over humanity under false pretences.

## Backstory

> Karl rose to prominence as the founder of neurospiritual research. A former scholar turned scientific leader, 
> Karl’s unwavering commitment to the welfare of the people drives him to oppose E.V.E.’s oppressive plans at 
> every turn.

Karl Strassman is a doctor from the [Union of Novosovia](../lore/novosovia), from the small town of Zelenopol. 
He was born with the (less rare) white haired variant of radiogenic leukotrichia. The condition is the result 
of nuclear fallout, from a war that started with distrust from Novosovia towards the DTC during Cold War 2.0. 
The war places Strassman's date of birth after 1983, making him 21 when he joins the Mantra cult.

We first see him working with [E.V.E](eve) in a [video](../for-sof/strassmancodec) unlocked on the 26th of May 2024
(IRL) in the [FOR SOF](../for-sof) folder. This was one of the earliest files after the release of the ARG on the 24th, 
introducing us to this key player in the story.

### Neospiritualism (<2004)

Dr. Karl Strassman was a researcher looking into the science of spiritualism. Before getting involved with Skys, 
Strassman founded Neospiritualism, as we learn from [Unbeleevable Episode 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2).
When [Skys](skys) came to Novosovia with his band [Skys & the Starjammers](../for-sof/skystarjammers) in 2004, 
his eccentric behaviour in interviews caught Strassman's attention. Despite his lack of traditional education, Skys' 
ideas were similar to those of his own cutting-edge research.

Much later in the timeline the [Science Study](../for-sof/thesciencestudy) is released in New Elysium in 2037 
with a picture of young Skys. This newspaper also presents a very critical article on Neospiritualism.

### Neosages (2004-2020)

Strassman's life would change on the 19th of December in 2004, at a Skys & the Starjammers show at the October 
Palace in Novosovia. He was eager to attend the party due to his interest in Skys, convincing his partner 
[Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren) to come along. They also took their assistant, Ro.

On this evening he met [Ava](ava), a red-haired woman he was immediately enchanted by. His partner Dallus had been hesitant 
to go in the first place and decided to leave at some point during the night. This prompted Skys to demonstrate his 
powers on assistant Ro. His abilities were a huge discovery, convincing Strassman and Dallus to join Skys in research. 
Both Strassman and Dallus became important members of the [cult](../lore/mantra).

Ava is Skys' best disciple, and he is not aware of the relationship forming between the two. Strassman sends 
Ava the [Russian Poem](../for-sof/russianpoem). In [Unbeleevable Episode 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3) it is revealed that 
she is pregnant with Strassman's child. After a Novosovian operative is identified as a traitor in the cult, he is 
used as an example and test subject for [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer). Since Strassman and Ava are 
still hiding their affair, she begs Strassman to flee from the cult.

In 2020, the Fall of October Palace took place, which was the end of the Mantra cult. Many cult members perished at 
the hands of Skys at his supposed funeral, which takes place during the [MANTRA](../music/amo-mantra) official music video. 
Strassman does not seem present at the funeral during the video.

### Operation Trinity (~Christmas Day 2020)

[Operation Trinity](../lore/operation-trinity) was a covert operation from the [DTC](../lore/dtc) government, 
ordered by [Victor Carmine](victor-carmine) from [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive). During the operation, the three men 
in charge of the Mantra cult were extracted. They were nicknamed "The Trinity".

We learn from [Dallus diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary), written a few weeks after Operation Trintity, that 
both Dallus and Strassman had families. Ava had Strassman's child Angel, but had sadly passed away at the 
time of writing. Angel is also missing, presumed dead. This has completely destroyed Strassman. 
Skys has also gone into a coma.

### SYNTH research (2027-203?)

Strassman is also involved in the [SYNTH](../lore/synths) project, around the time 
[Arc/Hive](../lore/archive) re-brands to [NEX GEN](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). One of the lab 
assistants named [Rebecca](rebecca) is terminally ill, with an environmental disease as we learn in her 
first [Grumblr post in January 2027](../for-sof/grumblr). Dallus Lauren is working on the research that eventually 
helps her transfer into a synthetic body.

[Months later in November](../for-sof/grumblr2), Rebecca is now working her first day with both Dallus and Strassman. 
She learns that Skys is still alive and the three of them transfer his consciousness into a synthetic body. 
Skys starts howling with laughter, before begging for death. Dallus and Strassman fight over this; Dallus regrets what 
they have done and states that they have crossed a boundary. Strassman insists that his reaction is due to the 
prolonged time Skys was in a coma. Not much later, Rebecca appears as the first synth in 2028 in the 
[Tekka interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview), where she is also asked about Strassman (among other Nex Gen employees).

The [D8 log](../for-sof/lauren_d8_log), from Dallus' son Ren in October 2037, speaks about his father's passing, 
leaving Strassman without his research partner. This log marks the activation of [E.V.E.](eve), who Strassman 
would start working closely with.

### Youtopia Research

Just a few days later in 2037, the [VSPR-37](../lore/vspr37) pandemic breaks out. NEX GEN's secret FANTOM 
team is sent out to retrieve two test subjects: [Selene](selene) (NYX-01) and [Scott](scott) (NYX-02). They trace 
Selene to Scott's house, who is suffering from severe symptoms from his VSPR-37 infection. We later learn that this 
turned him (and many others) into something called a voidling. 

Selene is bitten by Scott, but does not develop the virus. This immunity is of great interest to NEX GEN and Selene is 
now in their hands. They discover that Selene is special because of her pineal gland, which produces DMT, a rare trait 
in their current population.

> Selene, a 19-year-old female, was selected for this study due to her exceptionally high-functioning pineal gland
> and unique immunity to the current global virus. Her physiological and neurological characteristics made her an
> ideal candidate for exploring the LBRP’s potential to access alternate dimensions.

In 2038, Strassman writes his report on [Youtopia research with Selene](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc). He uses 
the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram as a way to help access dimension Y-93, colloquially known as 
[Youtopia](../lore/youtopia).

> Spiritual Cleansing: To be clear, The LBRP cannot open the doorway to Dimension Y-93 in itself. Instead, it
> cleansed Selene’s Astral Matrix, removing 16 Mare attachments. These entities are understood to feed on fear
> and disrupt spiritual progress, making it unsafe to access other dimensions without proper preparation.

Strassman is very positive about the results of the study. He reports that the ritual can indeed be used to 
remove negative energies, getting rid of [mares](../lore/mares), seemingly a necessary step to safely enter Youtopia.

### LBR Sites

The [LBR sites letter](../for-sof/lbr_sites) is written in 2038 to Victor Carmine and a redacted recipient. 
Strassman writes that two more Lesser Banishing Ritual sites have been approved above ancient Eldritch Conduits in the 
regions Heian-kyō and Naniwa-kyō. Several measures have been taken, due to an accident taking place in the final days 
of Arc/Hive. A [reconstructed interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview) with Carmine refers to the incident as 
"The Cradle Crash", an incident caused by energies exchanged with Dallus' consciousness.

### P.U.S.S-E Development

![Strassman in a conversation with Eve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/strassman/gallery/strassman_video.png)

In the video he can be seen speaking to Eve about the effects of [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse), which they have 
managed to successfully synthesise from Selene's unique indole alkaloid structure. He stresses that there are a 
lot of negative side effects to its use, to have people enter into [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia). E.V.E. insists 
that they must continue invoking Youtopia for humanity's future.
Strassman questions her intentions, pointing out that her power needs are growing and that she will need to sustain 
herself. He then accuses her of using the test subjects as batteries for her own selfish gain.

### Possible Death

He seemingly shoots himself/is shot at the end of the audio for [ABWMNO](../music/song-abwmno), after begging God 
for forgiveness for what he has done. It is unconfirmed who shot him, or whether he survived or not. It is unclear 
when this occurs, but likely after the 2039 events.
