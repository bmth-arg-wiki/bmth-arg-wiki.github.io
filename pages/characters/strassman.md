Dr. Karl Strassman is (or was) a scientist at [Nex Gen Corporation](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).
Early in the ARG, we learn that he helped [E.V.E](../characters/eve) gain control over humanity under false pretenses.

## Backstory

Karl Strassman is a doctor that works with [E.V.E](eve), as seen in a 
[video](../files/strassmancodec) unlocked on the 26th of May in the 
[FOR SOF](../files/for-sof) folder. This was one of the earliest files and 
has been upgraded in quality from its initial release.

![Strassman in a conversation with Eve](../../Resources/characters/strassman/strassman_video.png)

In the video he can be seen speaking to Eve about the effects of [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse). 
He stresses that there are a lot of negative side effects to its use, to have people 
enter into [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia).

He seemingly shoots himself/is shot at the end of the audio for [ABWMNO](../music/song-abwmno). 
It is unconfirmed who shot him, or whether he survived or not. It is unclear 
when this audio was recorded in-universe.
