video unlocked on the 26th of May in the [FOR SOF](../files/for-sof) folder.

In the video he can be seen speaking to Eve about the effects of [P.u.s.s-e](../lore/pusse). 
He stresses that there are a lot of negative side effects to its use, to have people 
enter into [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia).

He seemingly shoots himself at the end of the audio for [ABWMNO](../music/song-abwmno).
