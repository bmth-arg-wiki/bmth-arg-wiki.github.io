# Victor Carmine

Victor Carmine is the man at the head of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), later [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). 
He is the receiver of some files and ordered [Operation Trinity](../lore/operation-trinity), getting 
powerful [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra) knowledge into the company.

While he mostly operates from the inside, we see Victor Carmine appear in articles on [Mindstream](../lore/mindstream), 
Nex Gen's entertainment service that delivers entertainment directly to the brain. His current 
status is unknown by both us and [Sof](sof).

## Backstory

![Victor Carmine from Sof's journal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/refs/heads/main/characters/carmine/carmine_sof_journal.png)

Victor Carmine is the boss of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive) and later [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), re-branding 
after an incident the public calls the "Cradle Crash". He inherited his empire after the war, after his family with a 
particularly bloody legacy all lost their lives. He has strong ties to the [DTC](../lore/dtc) government, as well 
as family connections with [Novosovia](../lore/novosovia).

### Family Legacy

The first known Carmine is Domenico 'The Butcher' Carmine. During the Resource Wars, he hoarded supplies to run 
black-market food lines. This caused thousands to starve, while he executed others for resisting him.

Enzo 'Iron Fist' Carmine is also mentioned, likely being Victor's grandfather. He was responsible for the massacre at 
Santuario, where an innocent settlement was firebombed for not paying his family's extortion tariffs.

Luca Carmine, Victor's father, burned many districts during a period of class riots. The journalist in the 
[reconstructed interview](../for-sof/carmine_interview) even mentions speculation of Victor of murdering his own brothers, 
although Victor later claims in the same interview that they died in the war.

### Before Mantra

During Cold War 2.0, the conflict with Novosovia escalated because of more than politics and energy shortages. 
Victor Carmine was an astrobiologist at the time and obsessed with the aliens. Carmine used his father Luca's 
connections to create a peaceful agreement with Novosovia to send signals into space. The signals were 
sent from Evpatoria, a station in the tundra in Novosovia. They aimed their signals made of morse code straight at Venus. 
They used words like 'Varka' and 'Zinaida', words with real-life etymology tracing back to 'birth' and 'god'. 
In the interview it is noted that the words likely had symbolic meaning.

After decades, they received a strange faint signal in 1983. The Novosovians thought it was a hoax to trick 
them into lowering their guard. The conflict escalated, with the Novosovians' government afraid of losing the 
grip they had on their population through religion. Carmine was thrown into the Third World War. This caused 
him to lose his father and brothers, according to Carmine himself. After being seriously injured in the war, 
he also got his cybernetic parts, which he remakrs make him look "like a metal tin can". He inherited his whole 
family's empire after this. A prosthetic finger that matches Carmine's can be seen in the [artifacts](../for-sof/artifacts).

With Carmine now as the head of an empire, he went to the DTC to offer them his resources. His condition was that they 
would kill "the woman in the sky". He remarks that he saw what they did with 'it' in Novosovia, prompting him 
to make the demand despite its negative consequences for the economy.

### Project Kingslayer

In 2015, [Skys](skys) sent out an encrypted message to recruit the youth of [Novosovia](../lore/novosovia) into the cult. 
Carmine was working at [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), with close ties to the government. At the time, Novosovia 
was in their third Cold War with the [DTC](../lore/dtc), where Victor resided at Arc/Hive. Carmine was especially 
interested in their [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer). A man named [Alfgram](alfgram) claimed to 
wield an ancient power and the ability to traverse dimensions after being patient zero for the project. 

Victor Carmine then decides to send in his daughter using a fake name: [Medea](medea). She is instructed to seduce Skys, 
gain information, and bring down the cult. Skys falls for Medea, who eventually falls for him too and betrays her father, 
no longer contacting him. Most of the details of this area come from [Dr. Lee MD](lee-md) in his 
[third episode of Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable3).

### Operation Trinity

Victor Carmine ordered [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document) in 2020, ordering 
for the extraction of the three men from Novosovia during the fall of the [cult](../lore/mantra). He 
was interested in [Skys](skys), [Strassman](strassman), and [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren).

Strassman had a family at the time, but it is unknown what happens to them during the event. 
Skys was in a coma after the fall of Mantra, but successfully extracted to Arc/Hive. 
Dallus Lauren managed to flee Novosovia with his family, with his wife [Elena](elena-lauren) 
even giving birth to [Lyra](lyra-lauren) on the helicopter rescuing them (according to Sof's [journal](../website/journal.md). 
[Dallus' diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary). In the same diary from 2021, we learn that he was already preparing for 
the [SYNTH](../lore/synths) project, remarking that Carmine was "practically salivating".

### New Elysium

[New Elysium](../lore/new-elysium) is first mentioned (in the fictional timeline) in 
[Dallus' diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) from 2021. It is a community seemingly controlled by Arc/Hive (and later 
Nex Gen). It is a haven for survivors of the holy Eastern war.

[Selene](selene) and [Scott](scott) would later grow up here according to [Selene's diary](../for-sof/selene_personal_journal), 
two kids who are also referred to as NYX-01 and NYX-02 in the [Kingslayer codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec). 
Both Selene and [Scott's diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal) refer to drugs produced by Nex Gen Pharmaceuticals.

It seems like the company (and Victor) were likely responsible for human experimentation within this community.

### Project D.U.S.T.

[The Project D.U.S.T. research proposal](../for-sof/project_dust) by [Dr. Elias Mortem](elias-mortem) is written in 
2021, when Carmine was still leading the company. The proposal itself is addressed to a redacted person, only leaving 
"Director of Special Projects" visible. From a [reconstructed interview in 2037](../for-sof/carmine_interview) 
we get confirmation that Victor was responsible for the project.

The proposal describes several research projects, including [Project D.U.S.T.](../lore/incident-dust). 
It is a direct continuation of Project Kingslayer and a result of the October Massacre, signifying the end of 
the Mantra cult. The acronym D.U.S.T. means Deaths Unknown Spiritual Terrain.

During the fall of Mantra, the cult was able to fend off a great number of troops using a type of psychological weapon, 
terrifying soldiers. Arc/Hive works closely with the government, making this into an interesting opportunity to 
develop weapons to Carmine.

Mortem proposes experimentation on a redacted test group called the "Special Six", which they got through Operation Trinity. 
He also proposes a new second version of the "Altilium Chordata" tank. Finally, he is also interested in something called P.S.Y., 
or Psychoactive Structured Yttrium, which seems to help manifest supernatural powers. 

### Synths

Victor Carmine already showed interest in synthetic bodies shortly after Dallus arrived at Arc/Hive. 
When lab assistant [Rebecca](rebecca) posts about being diagnosed with CERS on [Grumblr](../for-sof/grumblr), 
Dallus is already working on the project, which is thought to be a way to save humanity. 

In 2028, Rebecca discusses her successful transition to her synth body in the [Tekka Interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview). 
We learn that Nex Gen makes Rebecca smoke as a PR stunt, to show how indestructible synth bodies are. At the 
time, they are even believed to be immune to addiction. Rebecca is asked about Victor Carmine in the 
interview by interviewer Jax Jackson, but refuses to talk about both the Trinity and Carmine.

The synth project continues and more people transfer themselves into synthetic bodies, 
[including celebrities](../website/tdw-clonechaos). Nex Gen also develops [combat synths](../website/tdw-roguesentinels), 
referred to by the public as Sentinels. From the article on Sentinels we also learn that they seem to 
be defying their programming. [Dr. Lee MD](lee-md) writes in the Daily Whisper about synths used 
for [very sinister purposes](../website/tdw-bloodredspectacles).

### Mindstream

Interestingly, Carmine appears in the news more publicly in articles about [Mindstream](../lore/mindstream). This 
is a cutting-edge entertainment service by Nex Gen, where brain interfaces communicate directly with the 
brain to deliver entertainment to the visual and fear-processing centres of the brain. Many criticize the technology, 
citing the difficulty in distinguishing between reality and artificial experience. Some even experience lasting 
symptoms, indicating that Mindstream might affect brain chemistry.

In an especially controversial decision from Nex Gen, they decide to air [Faith Over Flesh](../website/tdw-faithedge) 
on the company's network. In this show, a man named Jonah has recently found new faith. He is rumoured to be 
involved with [Ecliptism](../lore/ecliptism), a mysterious religion that uses pain to achieve salvation.

### LBR Sites

The [LBR sites letter](../for-sof/lbr_sites) is written from Strassman to Carmine. [Sof's journal](../website/journal) 
dates it back to 2038, indicating that Victor was around for at least some time after the creation of [E.V.E.](eve). 
Sof remarks in her journal that at some point, E.V.E. became the leader of Nex Gen and wonders what happened to 
Carmine.
