# Victor Carmine

Victor Carmine is the man at the head of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), later [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation). 
He is the receiver of some files and ordered [Operation Trinity](../lore/operation-trinity), getting 
powerful [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra) knowledge into the company.

While he mostly operates from the inside, we see Victor Carmine appear in articles on [Mindstream](../lore/mindstream), 
Nex Gen's entertainment service that delivers entertainment directly to the brain. His current 
status is unknown by both us and [Sof](sof).

## Backstory

![Victor Carmine from Sof's journal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/refs/heads/main/characters/carmine/carmine_sof_journal.png)

Victor Carmine is the boss of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive) and later [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), re-branding 
after an incident the public calls the "Cradle Crash".



### Project Kingslayer

In 2015, [Skys](skys) sent out an encrypted message to recruit the youth of [Novosovia](../lore/novosovia) into the cult. 
Carmine was working at [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), with close ties to the government. At the time, Novosovia 
was in their third Cold War with the [DTC](../lore/dtc), where Victor resided at Arc/Hive. Carmine was especially 
interested in their [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer). A man named [Alfgram](alfgram) claimed to 
wield an ancient power and the ability to traverse dimensions after being patient zero for the project. 

Victor Carmine then decides to send in his daughter using a fake name: [Medea](medea). She is instructed to seduce Skys, 
gain information, and bring down the cult. Skys falls for Medea, who eventually falls for him too and betrays her father, 
no longer contacting him. Most of the details of this area come from [Dr. Lee MD](lee-md) in his 
[third episode of Unbeleevable](../for-sof/unbeleevable3).

### Operation Trinity

Victor Carmine ordered [Operation Trinity](../for-sof/trinity_document) in 2020, ordering 
for the extraction of the three men from Novosovia during the fall of the [cult](../lore/mantra). He 
was interested in [Skys](skys), [Strassman](strassman), and [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren).

Strassman had a family at the time, but it is unknown what happens to them during the event. 
Skys was in a coma after the fall of Mantra, but successfully extracted to Arc/Hive. 
Dallus Lauren managed to flee Novosovia with his family, with his wife [Elena](elena-lauren) 
even giving birth to [Lyra](lyra-lauren) on the helicopter rescuing them (according to Sof's [journal](../website/journal.md). 
[Dallus' diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary). In the same diary from 2021, we learn that he was already preparing for 
the [SYNTH](../lore/synths) project, remarking that Carmine was "practically salivating".

### Project D.U.S.T.

[The Project D.U.S.T. research proposal](../for-sof/project_dust) by [Dr. Elias Mortem](elias-mortem) is written in 
2021, when Carmine was still leading the company. The proposal itself is addressed to a redacted person, only leaving 
"Director of Special Projects" visible. From a [reconstructed interview in 2037](../for-sof/carmine_interview) 
we get confirmation that Victor was responsible for the project.

The proposal describes several research projects, including [Project D.U.S.T.](../lore/incident-dust). 
It is a direct continuation of Project Kingslayer and a result of the October Massacre, signifying the end of 
the Mantra cult. The acronym D.U.S.T. means Deaths Unknown Spiritual Terrain.

During the fall of Mantra, the cult was able to fend off a great number of troops using a type of psychological weapon, 
terrifying soldiers. Arc/Hive works closely with the government, making this into an interesting opportunity to 
develop weapons to Carmine.

Mortem proposes experimentation on a redacted test group called the "Special Six", which they got through Operation Trinity. 
He also proposes a new second version of the "Altilium Chordata" tank. Finally, he is also interested in something called P.S.Y., 
or Psychoactive Structured Yttrium, which seems to help manifest supernatural powers. 

### Synths

Victor Carmine already showed interest in synthetic bodies shortly after Dallus arrived at Arc/Hive. 
When lab assistant [Rebecca](rebecca) posts about being diagnosed with CERS on [Grumblr](../for-sof/grumblr), 
Dallus is already working on the project, which is thought to be a way to save humanity. 

In 2028, Rebecca discusses her successful transition to her synth body in the [Tekka Interview](../for-sof/tekka_interview). 
We learn that Nex Gen makes Rebecca smoke as a PR stunt, to show how indestructible synth bodies are. At the 
time, they are even believed to be immune to addiction. Rebecca is asked about Victor Carmine in the 
interview by interviewer Jax Jackson, but refuses to talk about both the Trinity and Carmine.

The synth project continues and more people transfer themselves into synthetic bodies, 
[including celebrities](../website/tdw-clonechaos). Nex Gen also develops [combat synths](../website/tdw-roguesentinels), 
referred to by the public as Sentinels. From the article on Sentinels we also learn that they seem to 
be defying their programming. [Dr. Lee MD](lee-md) writes in the Daily Whisper about synths used 
for [very sinister purposes](../website/tdw-bloodredspectacles).

### Mindstream

Interestingly, Carmine appears in the news more publicly in articles about [Mindstream](../lore/mindstream). This 
is a cutting-edge entertainment service by Nex Gen, where brain interfaces communicate directly with the 
brain to deliver entertainment to the visual and fear-processing centres of the brain. Many criticize the technology, 
citing the difficulty in distinguishing between reality and artificial experience. Some even experience lasting 
symptoms, indicating that Mindstream might affect brain chemistry.

In an especially controversial decision from Nex Gen, they decide to air [Faith Over Flesh](../website/tdw-faithedge) 
on the company's network. In this show, a man named Jonah has recently found new faith. He is rumoured to be 
involved with [Ecliptism](../lore/ecliptism), a mysterious religion that uses pain to achieve salvation.

### LBR Sites

The [LBR sites letter](../for-sof/lbr_sites) is written from Strassman to Carmine. [Sof's journal](../website/journal) 
dates it back to 2038, indicating that Victor was around for at least some time after the creation of [E.V.E.](eve). 
Sof remarks in her journal that at some point, E.V.E. became the leader of Nex Gen and wonders what happened to 
Carmine.
