# Sof

Sof is the child from the cover art of [Post Human: NeX GEn](../music/ph-nex-gen). Their name was initially confirmed 
by mentions on the Horizon Supply website. These also confirmed that the teddy bear she has with her is named Vex.

This cover art also contained the first password needed: the access code for the website on the side of [M8](../m8)'s head.
The [first file](../for-sof/msgforsof) introduces the relationship between them and their mother, [Selene](selene) and the 
name of the [FOR SOF](../for-sof/for-sof) folder makes it clear that the information presented in the files is for them. 
The [booklet from the deluxe CD](../lore/booklet) also labels Sof and her mother Selene as our protagonists.

The access card designed to be shipped with the Sof statue specifically refers to Sof 
as "The Post Human". From the lore booklet we also learn that Sof is a non-binary demi-god, born in Nex Gen's labs.

## Backstory

Sof was born inside the Nex Gen lab, being born from the immune child [Selene](selene), someone Nex Gen also took 
great interest in. Only 20 minutes after their birth they were left in the care of AI assistant [M8](../m8), who was 
programmed to gradually reveal Sof's true origins.

The booklet states that Sof's special ability is that they were born a demi-god, with the power to bring light to darkness.

### Birth

Sof was born on the 25th of February 2040. Only 20 minutes after their birth, Selene records [msgforsof.aiff](../for-sof/msgforsof). 
During this first file in the ARG, Selene discusses how she will need to leave Sof behind. A baby can be heard crying in 
the background, as well as the sound of rain, indicating that they might no longer be in Nex Gen's lab. Selene is vague in 
the message, claiming that there is something she needs to do. Eventually, an alarm sounds and Selene states that is her 
cue and that she must leave. She leaves her baby in the care of AI assistant M8, who was developed by [Ikaro Lauren](ren).

### Sof starts a journal

In Sof's [journal](../website/journal.md) on the [webpage](../website/website), their age is hinted at twice. One is an off-hand 
remark about her being a strange 8-year-old. The other message is on the page about the Chapel Incident in 2040, where 
she remarks that it took place about eight years ago. The Dreadit post that Selene left for Sof is from 2052, which 
leaves questions about the exact timeline.

> I despise my mother.

Sof starts the journal by repeating this line three times, writing that they also have three reasons they blame their 
mother for leaving. Sof expresses being very confused about the vague messages that are left, their dislike of all the effort 
needed to unlock the files and being left in the care of M8. They also speak about a voidling outside their window, 
a creature that resulted from the [VSPR-37](../lore/vspr37) pandemic.
Sof indicates that they are living at the now-abandoned [Nex Gen lab](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), 
"re-wiring circuits and scavenging parts just to survive another day".

The webpage underwent big changes on the 4th of December, including the release of the journal. The website now includes 
an inventory with several puzzles too, used to unlock new files.

### Radiogenic Leukotrichia

Just like her mother Selene and mysterious cult leader [Skys](skys), Sof suffers a rare mutation of the condition Radiogenic 
Leukotrichia. This is a very rare condition that causes melanocytes, which give hair its colour, to be produced differently. 
The condition commonly results in white hair, but a rare mutation (affecting approximately 1 in 5 million babies) may 
cause them to be born with pink hair instead. 

The condition is described extensively in [The Science Study](../for-sof/thesciencestudy), specifically in an issue 
released in [New Elysium](../lore/new-elysium) in 2037. The same paper also discusses neurospiritual research, something 
her mother was also involved in with a scientist named [Dr. Karl Strassman](strassman). The condition appears to be 
the result of both environmental and genetic factors, causing Sof to wonder about their and their mother's connection to 
Skys in the journal.

## FOR SOF

[`FOR SOF`](../for-sof) refers to the folder in the ARG that we got access to using the first password within the website, 
after gaining access with the code 93934521 from M8's head on the album cover. The files 
we are seeing in this folder have all been left for her, to discover what her mom 
[Selene](selene) is trying to tell them. This is all about their `past`, the password for the folder itself.

## Speculation

Sof is speculated to be the prophecy on the album cover of [Post Human: Survival Horror](../music/ph-survival-horror), 
mainly due to the visual similarities like the pink skin and third eye.

The [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse) also gives indications that Skys was part of 
a prophecy, perhaps referring to the same image, even if Skys did not end up fulfilling it.
