# Sof

Sof is the child from the cover art. She is referred to as such in several descriptions 
on the Horizon merch website.
The [first file](../for-sof/msgforsof) introduces the relationship between them and their mother, [Selene](selene) and the 
name of the [FOR SOF](../for-sof/for-sof) folder makes it clear that the information presented in the files is for them.

The access card designed to be shipped with the Sof statue specifically refers to Sof 
as "The Post Human". The [lore booklet](../lore/booklet) refers to Sof using they/them pronouns.

## Identification

Since Sof is not a user in the [M8 system](../webpage), their name had to be determined from 
other sources, with the first being Horizon Supply. Horizon Supply listings also confirmed that the name of her bear is 
Vex. Sof is also the name the [lore booklet](../lore/booklet) uses to refer to them.

Sof was born inside the Nex Gen lab, being born from the immune child [Selene](selene), someone Nex Gen also took 
great interest in. Only 20 minutes after their birth they were left in the care of AI assistant [M8](../m8), who was 
programmed to gradually reveal Sof's true origins.

The booklet states that Sof's special ability is that they were born a demi-god, with the power to bring light to darkness.

## FOR SOF

[`FOR SOF`](../for-sof) refers to the folder in the ARG that we got access to using the first password within the website, 
after gaining access with the code 93934521 from M8's head on the album cover. The files 
we are seeing in this folder have all been left for her, to discover what her mom 
[Selene](selene) is trying to tell them.

## Speculation

She is theorized to also be on the cover of Post Human: Survival Horror. The NexGen album 
cover seems to show her with her third eye sewn shut. While the timeline is generally 
assumed to be linear (i.e. PH1 comes before PH2 in the timeline), there is still some 
discussion around the timeline.

The [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse) also gives indications that Skys was part of 
a prophecy, perhaps referring to the same image, even if Skys did not end up fulfilling it.
