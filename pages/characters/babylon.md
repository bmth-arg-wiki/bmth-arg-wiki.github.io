Thanks to sw33t_viol3nt_urg3 on Discord for enhancing the image scan from the booklet. This is currently the only 
available imagery, because The Babylon is notably missing from the user system on [M8](../m8).

## Backstory

> A beast as old as the land itself, it is fueled by Dark Matter, an evil & dangerous venom 
> that infects all that are bitten by it.

The [booklet](../lore/booklet) gives us most of the information we have about the Babylon, although 
it was mentioned by name only in the very early [Vision document](../lore/insight4-vision). The booklet 
paints it as a very dangerous three-headed snake, that can only be defeated through true vision. 
The reward for defeating the babylon is the golden raspberry.

The Golden Raspberry exists in real life as a parody award show for honoring cinematic failures and is described in the 
booklet as a reminder that one shouldn't take themselves too seriously. It symbolizes self-awareness.
