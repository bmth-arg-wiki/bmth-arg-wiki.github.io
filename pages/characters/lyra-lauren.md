# Lyra Lauren

Lyra Lauren is the younger sister of [Ren](ren) and the daughter of [Elena](elena-lauren) and [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren).

***

## Backstory

The start of Lyra's life was very rocky, with her mother going into labour while escaping Novosovia after the fall of [Mantra](../lore/mantra) 
in December 2020. She ended up being born safely at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive), with her family successfully escaping. 
Her father Dallus suffered from mares as a result of the events around the Mantra cult. 
Lyra suffered from the same affliction, manifesting the sleep paralysis demon-like creatures. We see drawings by one of 
Dallus' children in [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) and (likely) the [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) music video, 
which centers around Dallus and his trauma. These drawings are likely [Ren](ren)'s, since Lyra is not even a month old 
at the time of the proposal in January 2021.

This video also contains flashes of a car, reminiscent of the car crash mentions in [Rebecca's 2036 Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2). 
She mentions that Dallus' daughter died. Since Ren is still alive in 2037 to activate E.V.E., the child who died in the 
crash has to be Lyra, putting an end to her short story.
