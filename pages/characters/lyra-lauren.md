# Lyra Lauren

Lyra Lauren is the younger sister of [Ren](ren) and the daughter of [Elena](elena-lauren) and [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren).

***

## Backstory

The start of Lyra's life was very rocky, with her mother going into labour while escaping Novosovia after the fall of [Mantra](../lore/mantra) 
in December 2020. She ended up being born safely at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive), with her family successfully escaping. 
Her father Dallus suffered from mares as a result of the events around the Mantra cult. 
Lyra suffered from the same affliction, manifesting the sleep paralysis demon-like creatures. We see drawings by one of 
Dallus' children in [Project D.U.S.T.](../for-sof/project_dust) and (likely) the [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) music video, 
which centers around Dallus and his trauma. These drawings are likely [Ren](ren)'s, since Lyra is not even a month old 
at the time of the proposal in January 2021.

On the 5th of November Lyra Lauren mysteriously dies in a car crash, as we learn from the [webbrowser article on Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper). 
Gat3keeper was a technologically advanced theme park, where many ended up losing their lives. Much of this was to thank 
to an AI named Celesta, who's first reported malfunctioning was in 2036. 
On the night of the car crash, Dallus Lauren was driving his children Ren and Lyra home in routine traffic after 
visiting the park. Although the circumstances seemed normal, an accident occurred, which the officials ruled as a driver error. 
Rumors still circulated that the park had somehow influenced Dallus while driving that day, speculating about AI malfunctions 
and experimental features at the park.

The [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) video also contains flashes of a car and Rebecca mentions the crash in her  
[2036 Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2). This post was also made on the 25th of November, meaning Rebecca first worked 
with him on the 12-year anniversary of his daughter's death.
