# Lyra Lauren

Lyra Lauren is the younger sister of [Ren](ren) and the daughter of [Elena](elena-lauren) and [Dallus Lauren](dallus-lauren). 
Her mother goes into labour with her during [Operation Trinity](..), where her family is extracted to the [DTC](../lore/dtc) 
for their involvement with the [Mantra Cult](../lore/mantra). She is born shortly after the operation, in the safety 
of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive).

She tragically passes away young while being driven home by her father from the [Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper) 
theme park in 2024.

## Backstory

The start of Lyra's life was very rocky, with her mother going into labour while escaping Novosovia after the fall of [Mantra](../lore/mantra) 
in December 2020. She ended up being born safely at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive), with her family successfully escaping. 

### Mares

Lyra's father Dallus suffered from [mares](../lore/mares) as a result of the events around the Mantra cult. 
The young child suffered from the same affliction, manifesting the sleep paralysis demon-like creatures, despite not being 
born into the cult. According to [Dr. Elias Mortem](elias-mortem) in the 
[Project D.U.S.T.](../lore/incident-dust) [proposal](../for-sof/project_dust), this suggests that mares can be passed down 
epigenetically.

We see drawings by one of Dallus' children in project proposal and (likely) the [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) music video, 
which centers around Dallus and his trauma. The drawings in the 2021 proposal belong to [Ren](ren), since Lyra is still an 
infant.

### Car Crash

On the 5th of November 2024 Lyra Lauren mysteriously dies in a car crash, as we learn from the 
[Daily Whisper article on Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper). 
Gat3keeper was a technologically advanced theme park, where many ended up losing their lives. Many of these incidents 
involved an AI named Celesta, whose first reported malfunctioning was in 2036. 

On the night of the car crash, Dallus Lauren was driving his children Ren and Lyra home in routine traffic after 
visiting the park. Although the circumstances seemed normal, an accident occurred, which the officials ruled as a driver error. 
Rumours still circulated that the park had somehow influenced Dallus while driving that day, speculating about AI malfunctions 
and experimental features at the park.

The [in the dark](../music/amo-in-the-dark) video also contains flashes of a car, and Rebecca mentions the crash in her  
[2036 Grumblr post](../for-sof/grumblr2). This post was also made on the 25th of November, meaning Rebecca first worked 
with him shortly after the 12-year anniversary of her death.
