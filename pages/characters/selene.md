## Backstory

### Overview

Selene is the immune girl from the [Dreaddit post](../for-sof/dreadit) [E.V.E](eve) and [Dr. Karl Strassman](strassman) are studying.
Her high amounts of naturally produced DMT is what gave her the immunity to VSPR-37.
Because of [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) experimentations, she is now on an epic journey through [YOUtopia](../lore/youtopia).

The top right corner of the ARG website log-in page displays "SUBJECT SELENE".

### Teenage Years - VSPR-37 Outbreak

When the outbreak first started in late October 2037, Selene was only 16, making her birth year 2020 or 2021.

In [her diary](../for-sof/selene_personal_journal.md), she talks about "this flu [...] it's appeared pretty much overnight" 
and hearing her parents talking about "stocking up on supplies".
She also mentions how she's worried about her friend (and crush) [Scott](syko), who she hasn't seen in three days. 
Selene then plans on visiting him the next day if he still doesn't show up to school.

Scott also talks about her in [his diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal), writing "wish I could see her" when he can't go to school, 
and "My moon, I wish I told u. Mayb u already nu..." when he gets really sick.

### Motherhood

It is revealed in the [msgforsof audio log](../for-sof/msgforsof) that Selene is [Sof](sof)'s mother, 
and that she left them in the care of [M8](../m8) within 20 minutes of their birth. 
She states having "to do something first" and takes off after hearing an alarm, saying the alarm is "her cue". 
She mentions that M8 has been with her for a while, and has saved her life countless times, 
even highlighting that M8 may have done the same for Sof by now.

## Current goals

Through [E.V.E.](eve)'s experiments to upregulate her DMT production, 
Selene reached a "dreamlike state unlike anything ever witnessed before" known as [YOUtopia](../lore/youtopia).
She now has to journey through this mystical land to discover the ancient mysteries of the world.

## Selene & the CAPSLOCK DOC

Selene is connected to the [CAPSLOCK DOC](../for-sof/capslock_doc), which was opened earlier in the timeline than expected by the devs. 
For this reason, spoilers for this document are contained to its article.
