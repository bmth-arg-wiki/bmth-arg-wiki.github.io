# Selene

![Selene's Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/characters/selene/3selene.png)

Selene is user 002 in the newest version of the website. She is one of the protagonist of the story, having giving 
birth to our other protagonist in [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation)'s labs: demi-god [Sof](sof). She has to leave 
Sof shortly after birth, putting her in the care of AI assistant [M8](../m8).

Nex Gen is very interested in Selene due to her unique pineal gland. She produces an exceptional amount of DMT, 
something which eventually helps her reach [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) as [documented by Nex Gen](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc).

## Backstory

### Overview

Selene is the immune girl from the [Dreaddit post](../for-sof/dreadit) [E.V.E](eve) and [Dr. Karl Strassman](strassman) are studying.
Her high amounts of naturally produced DMT is what gave her the immunity to the [VSPR-37](../lore/vspr37) pandemic. 

[Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) retrieves her during the outbreak of the pandemic as seen in the 
[Kingslayer Codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec). The codec also reveals that they have codenamed Selene NYX-01, labelling 
[Scott](scott) as NYX-02.

The top right corner of the ARG website log-in page displays "SUBJECT SELENE".

### Teenage Years - VSPR-37 Outbreak

When the outbreak first started in late October 2037, Selene writes in her journal that she is 16 years old and 
in [New Elysium](../lore/new-elysium).

In [her diary](../for-sof/selene_personal_journal), she talks about "this flu [...] it's appeared pretty much overnight" 
and hearing her parents talking about "stocking up on supplies".
She also mentions how she's worried about her friend (and crush) [Scott](syko), who she hasn't seen in three days. 
Selene then plans on visiting him the next day if he still doesn't show up to school.

Scott also talks about her in [his diary](../for-sof/scott_personal_journal), writing "wish I could see her" when he can't go to school, 
and "My moon, I wish I told u. Mayb u already nu..." when he gets really sick.

The [Kingslayer codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec) reveals what really happened that day: Scott attacked Selene and was 
shot dead by Nex Gen's FANTOM team, trying to recover their test subjects. They are able to recover Selene, who they 
find out is immune to the VSPR-37 virus.

### Youtopia Research

A [document from the pop-up shops](../for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc) reveals more about Selene's time at Nex Gen. 
She is working with their research department on entering dimension Y-93, also known as [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia). 
Interestingly, this document lists her as being 19 years old in 2038, indicating that Selene might not even be aware 
of her real age.

The document details the role of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP). This is a ritual that also 
exists in the real world, taking more inspiration from Thelema for the ARG. The LBRP helps cleanse the Astral Matrix 
according to the research, since dark entities called [mares](../lore/mares) can cause severe harm when trying to access 
Youtopia. The author also emphasises that the ritual alone is not enough to travel to Youtopia.

After months of performing the LBRP daily, Selene manages to visualise an entrance way to Youtopia, entering it 
for the first time on April 23, 2038.

From the [Strassman codec](../for-sof/strassmancodec) we learn that [Strassman](strassman) and [E.V.E.](eve) are 
responsible for developing [P.U.S.S-E](../lore/pusse) from Selene's unique indole alkaloid structure. The drug is 
used to allow access to Youtopia. It also suggests that the initial research document may have been written by 
Strassman, whose unique knowledge of neurospirituality has long been of interest to Nex Gen.

### Motherhood

It is revealed in the [msgforsof audio log](../for-sof/msgforsof) that Selene is [Sof](sof)'s mother, 
and that she left them in the care of [M8](../m8) within 20 minutes of their birth. [Sof's journal](../website/journal) 
reveals the date this happened: February 25th in 2040.
She claims to have "to do something first" and takes off after hearing an alarm, saying the alarm is "her cue". 
She mentions that M8 has been with her for a while, and has saved her life countless times, 
even highlighting that M8 may have done the same for Sof by the time she hears the message.

### Sof's Journal

Selene leaves several files for Sof, allowing them to slowly discover their past. From the journal we learn that 
Selene still has not returned, leaving Sof frustrated and angry. She is at least 8 years old while writing (part of) the 
journal, referring to 2040 as eight years ago.

## Selene & the CAPSLOCK DOC

Selene is connected to the [CAPSLOCK DOC](../for-sof/capslock_doc), which was opened earlier in the timeline than expected by the devs. 
For this reason, spoilers for this document are contained to its article. The email in the document has been inactive for 
a very long time and is not expected to be replaced soon.

## Website History

Selene was user 0003 in the first version of the [Multidimensional Navigator 8](../website/website). Her user number 
was also used as the password for her [diary](../for-sof/selene_personal_journal).
