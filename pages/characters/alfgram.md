# Alfgram

Alfgram is one of [Skys'](skys) most loyal disciples. He was patient zero for [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer), 
after which he claimed to have access to ancient powers. He also claimed he was able to visit different 
realities. This eventually results in research into [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) with [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).

## Background

Alfgram's backstory is largely unknown. [Dr. Lee MD](lee-md) mentions him in his show [Unbeleevable (episode 3)](../for-sof/unbeleevable3). 
He explains that [Skys](skys) tortured people in the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra). In 2015, Alfgram became the first 
test subject for his project Kingslayer. After going through the ritual, the man claims to have gained access to 
mysterious powers.

Most of the information about Alfgram and his motivations comes from 
the [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse), where is he portrayed as a saviour who suffered to help others. 
In the book, he falls out with Skys, questioning his motivations. Alfgram ends up leaving with his closest 
disciples in the night, which ends in a revenge mission from Skys. As Skys murders Alfgram, the book claims he 
reached enlightenment.
