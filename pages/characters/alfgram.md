# Alfgram

> Alfgram beheld Skys and gave him his pledge, swearing his hands to the work, his soul to the trials, 
> and his flesh to the altar of suffering. For in Skys, he saw not just a prophet, but the path to a 
> kingdom beyond all pain, a place where the soul would stand unbound by flesh.

Alfgram is one of [Skys'](skys) most loyal disciples. He was patient zero for [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer), 
after which he claimed to have access to ancient powers. He also claimed he was able to visit different 
realities. This eventually results in research into [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia) with [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation).

## Background

Alfgram's backstory is largely unknown. [Dr. Lee MD](lee-md) mentions him in his show [Unbeleevable (episode 3)](../for-sof/unbeleevable3). 
He explains that [Skys](skys) tortured people in the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra). In 2015, Alfgram became the first 
test subject for his project Kingslayer. After going through the ritual, the man claims to have gained access to 
mysterious powers.

Most of the information about Alfgram and his motivations comes from 
the [Book of Eclipse](../for-sof/book-of-eclipse), where is he portrayed as a saviour who suffered to help others. 
In the book, he is referred to as First Shadow, the Shepherd of Suffering.

Somewhere after [Project Kingslayer](../lore/incident-kingslayer), he falls out with Skys, questioning his motivations. 
Alfgram ends up leaving with his closest disciples in the night, which ends in a revenge mission from Skys. 
As Skys murders Alfgram, the book claims he reached enlightenment. Alfgram was not known to be extracted in 
[Operation Trinity](../lore/operation-trinity) or mentioned in [Dallus' diary](../for-sof/dallus-diary) 
written shortly after the operation. This puts the most likely time for his death somewhere between 2015 and 2020.
