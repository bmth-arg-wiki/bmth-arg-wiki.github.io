> Scott‚Äôs Diary

> October 28, 2037
>
> Dear Diary,
>
> I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but something‚Äôs up. Feeling like actual; shit. Oskar won‚Äôt stop barking, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the TV is bust.
Seems like every channel is playing the same news story, it‚Äôs sending me insane. What‚Äôs even crazier-earlier, somebody bit me, BIT ME.
>
> Ceto has always been a sketch head, but he‚Äôs clearly dipping way too much into his own stash now. I‚Äôm going to have to look for another hookup. I know, I know, I said I was clean. But it‚Äôs just Nexies. I would never have managed to handle all my extra ciric without them.
>
> Between Advanced Neuro and Bio-DM, I was drowning. And his stuff is next level, like he was getting it straight from the source. No brain buzz, barely any twitch. But now I‚Äôve got cold sweats, and my vision is starting to blur. 
>
> Is the fallout kicking in already? Or did I catch something off that waster!? Surely not‚Ä¶I tried to clean the bite mark, but it keeps oozing this nasty, yellowish fluid‚Ä¶
>
> What a fucking day.

> October 29, 2037
>
> Dear Diary,
>
> I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually going to take a day off school. Haven‚Äôt missed one since 4th grade. I know that‚Äôs a pretty nerdy flex, but I don‚Äôt give a shit.
>
> The world‚Äôs gonna know my name-even if it kills me. But..I gotta be real..there‚Äôs no way I can go. I‚Äôm fucked. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just the fallout but I‚Äôm low key scared I‚Äôve caught this flu this TV keeps banging on about.
>
> I feel kinda itchy, kinda like there‚Äôs bugs under my skin. My reflection is so grey, my eyes are sunken, like, even more than usual.
My thoughts are all fuzzy‚Ä¶It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm forgetting who I am‚Ä¶Selene keeps coming to my mind‚Ä¶wish I could see her, but she can‚Äôt see me like this. Everything‚Äôs like a fever dream‚Ä¶
>
> To make things worse, the dog‚Äôs gone rabid. Barking at me like he hates me. Wish he would shut the fuck up, he‚Äôs doing my head in. 
Fuck, how long have I been in my room? Where‚Äôs Mum? I‚Äôm fading in and out. Don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôve been. I feel so hungry. When did I last eat? The itching is unbearable. I just scratched myself so hard I drew blood.
>
> What the hell is happening?
