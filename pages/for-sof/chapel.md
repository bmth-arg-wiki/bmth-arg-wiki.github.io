# Chapel Incident video

[Sof's](../characters/sof) [journal](../website/journal) states that there was an incident in a chapel in 2040. They 
mention it might have something to do with [Project D.U.S.T.](../lore/incident-dust). The end result was Dr. Elias Mortem, 
, and his team getting slaughtered.

## About

This video was first found on the USBs from the pop-up shops on the 27th of September 2024, the release date of the album. 
It also appeared as a file in the [FOR SOF](for-sof#for-sof) folder,
but the community never managed to open it. It is no longer available in that folder after an update in December 2024, 
but can be opened through Sof's journal on the [webpage](../website/website).
