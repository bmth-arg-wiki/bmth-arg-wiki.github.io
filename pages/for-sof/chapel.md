# Chapel

We learn from Sof's journal that there was an incident in a chapel. They mention it might have something to do with 
[Project D.U.S.T.](project_dust). The end result was Dr. Elias Mortem, involved with several of the files, and his team 
getting slaughtered.

## About

This video was first found on the USBs from the pop-up shops on the 27th of September 2024, the release date of the album. 
It also appeared as a file in the [FOR SOF](for-sof#for-sof) folder, 
but the community never managed to open it. It is no longer available in that folder after an update in December 2024, 
but can be opened through Sof's journal on the [webpage](../webpage).
