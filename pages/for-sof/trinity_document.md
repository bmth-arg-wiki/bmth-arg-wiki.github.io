> "It is said that Trinity is intact."

This file was introduced in an update on 19-06-2024. It confirms that there is lore for the 
ARG hidden in BMTH's music since [Amo](../music/amo).
It was the first reveal that the [MANTRA cult](../lore/mantra) was a part of the story.

> It is believed that ARC/HIVE recognizes the potential of their research

> 
> Whether they offered safe passage only to "Trinity" or more individuals is still unknown,
> but it is reported that they have been separated from their families. Rumors of Skais's (Skys) death are being questioned, as it is said that Trinity is intact, implying that they are being transported simultaneously.

(Translation by @siensto and @beelzs_son on Discord)

The article explains the importance of the [three key figures](../characters#trinity) 
and their research, which we learn more about in other files.
[Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) is also asked about [Operation Trinity](trinity_document), 
but is not eager to answer questions asked by interviewer Jax Jackson in the [Tekka interview](tekka_interview).

Note that we learn from the [Project D.U.S.T research proposal](project_dust) 
that six children with special psychic powers were also recovered during Operation Trinity, 
information that was unknown to the writer of this document.
