# Module Puzzle Artifacts

The module puzzles are connector-type puzzles that reveal six different 3D models, which seem to be 
connected to the characters in our world.

## About

Three new puzzles and an idle game dropped in an update on the 16th of July 2025. The 
key to this puzzle is three module puzzles that must be assembled in the right 
order to reveal three artifacts: Vex, Strassman's glasses and M8.

On the 20th of August, another three puzzles were added, revealing more artifacts! The same 
updated added some changes to the [painting puzzle](../website/emulator-escape), allowing 
the community to solve this puzzle too. The new artifacts are a prosthetic finger, a trampled 
plushie and sandpit turtle.

Our preferred strategy to solve the puzzles is to label each piece with a number. Start at piece 1, then
keep track of which piece you are on while clicking. Click on the 'password' tabs to reveal the correct order.

{{"![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/artifacts/solved/blue.png)" | markdownify}}

</details>

The blue puzzle unlocks artifact #002: a 3D model of [Strassman](../characters/strassman)'s glasses.
The glasses might be some sort of technology as well, since they do not look like ordinary glasses.
They are labelled as being from [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), and at least one of the lenses is cracked.

### Purple Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 5, 10, 6, 11, 2, 4, 7, 8, 1, 9, 3

</details>

The purple puzzle unlocks artifact #003, which is our very own [M8 (character)](../m8). She is labelled as

in a rendering of him in Sof's [journal](../website/journal).

### Red Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 3, 1, 6, 11, 9, 10, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8

{{"![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/artifacts/solved/red.png)" | markdownify}}

</details>

The puzzle reveals a bloodied [trampled plushie](#gat3keeper-plushie) 
with a [Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper) logo on its tag. The plushie 
seems to be related to one of the incidents mentioned in the article on 
[the Daily Whisper](../website/website#the-daily-whisper).

The second green puzzle unlocks [Sandpit Turtle](#sandpit-turtle). This is a joke from the Bring Me The Horizon fandom 
based on the song Shadow Moses. The line "This is sempiternal" is often jokingly replaced by "This is sandpit turtle".
