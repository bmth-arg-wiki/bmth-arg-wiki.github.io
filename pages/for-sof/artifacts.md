# Module Puzzle Artifacts

> In YOUtopia, four ancient relics away Selene’s discovery, each imbued with unique powers essential for 
> completing the hero’s journey. These coveted artifacts, scattered across the land, hold the key to unlocking 
> the true potential of YOUtopia and overcoming the challenges that lie ahead. Each Relic is held by the four 
> Omen’s that walk the land of Youtopia which Selene will need to uncover.

The module puzzles are connector-type puzzles that reveal six different 3D models, which seem to be 
connected to the characters in our world.

## About

Three new puzzles and an idle game dropped in an update on the 16th of July 2025. The 
key to this puzzle is three module puzzles that must be assembled in the right 
order to reveal three artifacts: Vex, Strassman's glasses and M8.

On the 20th of August, another three puzzles were added, revealing more artifacts! The same 
updated added some changes to the [painting puzzle](../website/emulator-escape), allowing 
the community to solve this puzzle too. The new artifacts are a prosthetic finger, a trampled 
plushie and sandpit turtle.

Our preferred strategy to solve the puzzles is to label each piece with a number. Start at piece 1, then
keep track of which piece you are on while clicking. Click on the 'password' tabs to reveal the correct order.

with a [Gat3keeper](../website/tdw-gatekeeper) logo on its tag. The plushie 
seems to be related to one of the incidents mentioned in the article on 
[the Daily Whisper](../website/website#the-daily-whisper).

{{"![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/artifacts/solved/green2.png)" | markdownify}}

</details>

The second green puzzle unlocks [Sandpit Turtle](#sandpit-turtle). This is a joke from the Bring Me The Horizon fandom 
based on the song Shadow Moses. The line "This is sempiternal" is often jokingly replaced by "This is sandpit turtle". 
Sandpit Turtle can also be seen on [Selene's Journal](selene_personal_journal) as a sticker.

### Dark Purple Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 11, 7, 6, 8, 1, 10, 5, 9, 2, 3, 4
</details>

The dark purple puzzle unlocks [an umbrella](#thats-the-spirit-umbrella), from the cover of the album "That's The Spirit". 
This puzzle and the item itself were released around the anniversary of the album and no lore connection is known.

### Pink Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 3, 5, 9, 1, 7, 6, 11, 2, 4, 8, 10
</details>

The pink puzzle unveils a [3D model of the cap and the archangel patches](#cap--archangel-patches) that have been added to the shop on 
the [website](../website/website). [M8](../m8) is inside the cap.

### Silver/Purple Puzzle

</details>
4, 7, 9, 6, 10, 1, 11, 8, 2, 3, 5

The silver-purple-y puzzle reveals [Leech Blood Hair Dye](#leech-blood-hair-dye). The dye ties back 
to [Skys](../characters/skys), who dyed his hair with leech blood in Ingleterra when he was alone in 
an abandoned asylum (Source: [Unbeleevable 2](../for-sof/unbeleevable2)).

The label on the bottle has the text 'DCPHR-4', along with a sequence of characters: `6479bnmcxz`. 
This is theorised to be a clue to [Victor's Journal](../for-sof/carmine_interview)'s final tab, which is still locked 
behind a cipher at the time of writing.

### Grey/Silver Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 11, 7, 6, 8, 1, 10, 5, 9, 2, 3, 4
</details>

The darker silver/grey puzzle reveals a 3D model of a [mask](#fantom-mask) used by 
[Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation)'s FANTOM team. It is unknown who it belongs to, but 
could be related to the events around [Unbeleevable 1 leak](../for-sof/unbeleevable) or the 
[Kingslayer Codec](../for-sof/kingslayercodec).

[Dr. Lee MD](../characters/lee-md). Lee is an enemy of [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation), revealing 
their secrets in Unbeleevable [1](unbeleevable), [2](unbeleevable2) and [3](unbeleevable3).
