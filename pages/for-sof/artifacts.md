# Slider Puzzle Artifacts

> In YOUtopia, four ancient relics away Selene’s discovery, each imbued with unique powers essential for 
> completing the hero’s journey. These coveted artifacts, scattered across the land, hold the key to unlocking 
> the true potential of YOUtopia and overcoming the challenges that lie ahead. Each Relic is held by the four 
> Omen’s that walk the land of Youtopia which Selene will need to uncover.

The slider puzzles are connector-type puzzles that reveal three different 3D models. These are all labelled 
as artifacts, all of them being items we have seen in the ARG before.

## About

Three new puzzles and an idle game dropped in an update on 16-07-2025. The 
key to this puzzle is three module puzzles, that must be assembled in the right 
order to reveal three artifacts. These are likely the artifacts mentioned in the [booklet](../lore/booklet), 
although one is notably missing.

Our preferred strategy to solve the puzzles is to label each piece with a number. Start at piece 1, then
keep track of which piece you are on while clicking. Click on the 'password' tabs to reveal the correct order.

### Green Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 1, 11, 8, 2, 4, 9, 10, 7, 6, 5, 3

{{"![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/artifacts/solved/green.png)" | markdownify}}

</details>

The green puzzle unlocks artifact #001: a 3D model of Vex, labeled as "[Sof](../characters/sof)'s bear".

### Blue Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 8, 2, 6, 10, 1, 9, 11, 5, 3, 7, 4

{{"![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/artifacts/solved/blue.png)" | markdownify}}

</details>

The blue puzzle unlocks artifact #002: a 3D model of [Strassman](../characters/strassman)'s glasses.
The glasses might be some sort of technology as well, since they do not look like ordinary glasses.
They are labelled as being from [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), and at least one of the lenses is cracked.

### Purple Puzzle

<details class="password">
<summary>Password</summary>
Order for the pieces: 5, 10, 6, 11, 2, 4, 7, 8, 1, 9, 3

</details>

The purple puzzle unlocks artifact #003, which is our very own [M8](../m8). She is labelled as
`[Multidimensional] M8`.
