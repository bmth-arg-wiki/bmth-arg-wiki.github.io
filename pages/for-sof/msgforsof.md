> I never believed in destiny, but now I see...
> your destiny. You will be the one leads us out of this darkness.

In this audio log Selene says goodbye to [SOF](../characters/sof) after just giving birth to her less 
than 20 minutes ago. A baby is softly crying/making noises in the background and water is running. 
She tells SOF that she has to leave and that M8 has saved Selene's life a few times. 
M8 might even have saved SOF's life one or multiple times by the time she hears this recording. 
She speaks on how M8's character is 'a little bit crazy', but that she will protect you. 
Selene says that M8 is hiding the past, but for good reason. 

You can also hear thunder partway through the audio, which upsets the baby, causing Selene to soothe 
her.
She says that there is something she still needs to do. Near the end of the recording an alarm goes off, which prompts Selene to say that's her cue, 
say a few more words goodbye and then end the recording.

## About

This is the first file, an audio log from [Selene](../characters/selene) to [Sof](../characters/sof).
This file is not password protected. This file is very lore-heavy and will introduce us to
the premise of the ARG: we are exploring the files Selene left for her daughter.

## Transcription

> Hi Sof. This is Selene. 
I‚Äôm your‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm your mother. 
I‚Äôm recording this message while holding you, staring into your eyes, 
trying to contemplate how the hell I‚Äôm going to do this. 
Because even though you are the most beautiful creature I‚Äôve ever seen, 
even though I gave birth to you less than 20 minutes ago, I have to leave you.
>
> Just saying those words destroys me more than you will ever know, and 
I never expect you to forgive me for this. 
But one day I hope you will be able to at least understand. 
>
> Ok. Where do I start? If you‚Äôre listening to this, it means you survived. 
And I guess it means you managed to decrypt M8, she‚Äôs a little bit crazy but trust her, 
she saved my life more times than I can remember. 
She has no doubt already done the same for you. 
>
> But more importantly, she holds the keys to unlocking the past that has been hidden from you, 
for good reason. Because if I told you everything now, best case, 
you simply wouldn‚Äôt understand. Worst case, it would fuck your head up so bad 
that you would never come back, and I need this to be your choice.
> You decide.
> If you want to go any further, if you want to know any more
Because unlocking these secrets will be difficult, but learning the truth will be harder. 
>
> [thunder]
> Shh, it‚Äôs ok, it can‚Äôt hurt you. I never believed in destiny, but now I see...
> your destiny. You will be the one leads us out of this darkness.
> But for that to happen, there‚Äôs something I must do. There‚Äôs somewhere I must go.
> And I want‚Ä¶ 
>
> [alarm]
> Fuck. That‚Äôs my cue. 
>
> Remember Sof,
> [Selene whispers what I think is Sof‚Äôs name a few more times].
> You're not alone. Even though I‚Äôm far away, I'm always with you.
> Believe in yourself and you will find the way.
> I love you. I love you. I.. I‚Äôm sorry.
>
> [alarm still blaring, beep before recording ends]
