# Dallus' Diary

This entry tells us more about how Dallus ended up working with [Skys](../characters/skys), [Strassman](../characters/strassman) 
and [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine). Apparently, Skys did something to Dallus Lauren at the Skys & the Starjammers 
concert at the October Palace, convincing him to get involved with the [Cult of MANTRA](../lore/mantra) and [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive), 
the company that would later carry out [Operation Trinity](trinity_document).

We also learn more about his family: his wife Elena went into labour while they were fleeing with [Ren](../characters/ren) 
from Novosovia, the location of the MANTRA cult. Their youngest daughter Lyra was born at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) and ends 
up dying in a car crash. Rebecca's [second Grumblr post](grumblr2) from November 2036 
mentions this happened a few years before and Dallus is still only half there. Since Ren is alive to 
activate [EVE](../characters/eve) in 2037 according to the [D8 log](lauren_d8_log), the child who died had to have been 
Lyra.

The diary is from the 19th of January 2021.

## Transcription

>Diary Entry: January 19th, 2021
>
>I have been advised by the psychiatrist to start keeping a journal, 
> ostensibly to aid in processing the rather cataclysmic events of recent months. 
> It appears that everyone around here keeps one, 
> which makes me feel as though I‚Äôve been thrust back into the agonizingly banal routine of high school.
>
>Ren, ever the prodigious spirit, has already suggested the creation of a journal robot she whimsically calls D8, 
> part of her RO8OT line. She envisions eight distinct AI helpers, each with specialized functions. 
> The sheer inventiveness of her young mind is as endearing as it is impressive.
>
>However, I supposed I can utilize this exercise for a dual purpose: to detail my analyses and track the progress of my work, 
> and perhaps to untangle the Gordian knot of my psyche.
>
>Despite her tender age, her creativity and zeal are palpable, 
> and I find myself oscillating between immense pride and a profound sense of trepidation. 
> It‚Äôs clear she aims to follow in my footsteps, and that thought alone fills me with a m√©lange of pride and a daunting responsibility.
>
>The specter of loss looms large. So many comrades have fallen, their memories now lingering phantoms. 
> Strassman, my steadfast colleague, was not spared. 
> The loss of his child shortly after Ava‚Äôs death is a tragedy that defies even the most stoic rationalization. 
> Angel is presumed dead, and Strassman‚Äôs reticent demeanor conceals a maelstrom of grief and anxiety that resonates deeply with my own.
>
>The ordeal of escaping with Elena, and Ren, while Elena went into labor, 
> tested our mettle in ways I could scarcely have anticipated. 
> Yet, in the advanced medical sanctum of ARC/HIVE, Lyra was born. 
> Fragile proof that life can persist even in the bleakest circumstances.
>
>And then there‚Äôs Skys. That psychopathic megalomaniac whose delusions of grandeur led us down this path. 
> And now, despite his comatose state, ARC/HIVE has brought his useless body back. 
> For what purpose? It‚Äôs a macabre souvenir of madness, a chilling reminder of the depths to which we sank.
>
>Operation Trinity, ARC/HIVE‚Äôs grand extraction schemes executed with clinical precision. 
> They seized the chaos in Novosovia to extract the ‚ÄúTrinity‚Äù: myself, Strassman, and the body of Skys. 
> Promises of protection and resources were dangled like carrots, and we were spirited away to this high-tech purgatory. 
> Strassman and I were put to work immediately, our expertise now at the service of ARC/HIVE‚Äôs ambitions.
>
>The separation from our families, the relentless pressure to produce results, it all weighs heavily. 
> However, I can‚Äôt deny the miracle of this second chance, after everything we‚Äôve endured and everything we‚Äôve done. 
> I must admit, New Elysium is a beautiful community, one I never imagined I could be a part of, even if I don‚Äôt get to enjoy it much. 
> I have to be thankful for Arc/hive in the way they have looked after our survivors of the holy eastern war.
>
>The SYNTH project is a Herculean undertaking. The notion of transferring human consciousness into synthetic vessels, 
> creating Synthetic Neurological Transference Humans, is rife with potential and peril. 
> The prospect of enhancing cognitive functions and transcending our physical limitations is intoxicating.
>
>Yet, the ethical ramifications are labyrinthine. But I‚Äôm thankful, albeit slightly shaken, 
> by Victor Carmine‚Äôs interest in my pitch. He was practically salivating.
>
>The MOXY Pack, however, is a far more straightforward endeavor. 
> Engineered to provide breathable air amidst our increasingly toxic environment, 
> these devices represent the culmination of my life‚Äôs work. 
> Post-war environmental degradation has reached apocalyptic levels, 
> and the MOXY Packs are crucial for the continued well-being of humanity, 
> particularly in developing nations where thousands perish daily.
>
>The underlying science is both intricate and imperative, 
> incorporating advanced filtration systems and sustainable air production methodologies. 
> Most of the groundwork is complete, and with Victor‚Äôs seemingly inexhaustible financial resources, 
> the MOXY Pack will soon transition from concept to reality.
>
>Despite the intellectual fervor these projects incite, a pall of apprehension and dread lingers. 
> The tenuous nature of our existence and the precariousness of our achievements are omnipresent. 
> Rationality serves as my bulwark against these uncertainties, yet the emotional toll is inexorable. 
> The loss of friends, the ever-present specter of danger, and the weight of responsibility bear down with relentless intensity.
>
>Tomorrow, I shall enter the lab with renewed vigor, 
> tempered by the indelible memories of those we have lost and the ever-looming specter of our collective anxieties. 
> The path ahead is fraught with perils, yet the promise of groundbreaking discoveries propels me inexorably forward. 
> For Elena, for Ren, for my precious baby Lyra, and for the prospective future of humanity, I must remain resolute.
>
>I must admit, after this exercise, I feel an unexpected sense of relief. 
> Perhaps the quack they have employed here at ARC/HIVE isn‚Äôt as dim as I discredited her for.
>
>Dallus Lauren
