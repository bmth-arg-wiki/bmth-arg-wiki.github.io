# Dallus' Diary

> More content coming soon!

[Dallus](../characters/dallus-lauren)' diary is a file found after the December 2024 update, although its background briefly appeared when 
the [Grumblr](grumblr) file first opened, at the time displaying the text `test` in green. According to [Sof](../characters/sof)'s 
journal, the diary is from the 19th of January 2021.

The diary tells us more about how Dallus ended up working with [Skys](../characters/skys), [Strassman](../characters/strassman) 
and [Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine). Apparently Skys did something to Dallus Lauren at the Skys & the Starjammers 
concert at October Palace, convincing him to get involved with the [Cult of MANTRA](../lore/mantra) and the company that 
would later carry out [Operation Trinity](trinity_document).

We also learn more about his family: his wife Elena went into labour while they were fleeing with [Ren](../characters/ren) 
from Novosovia, the location of the Mantra cult. Their youngest Lyra was born at [ARC/HIVE](../lore/archive) and ends 
up dying in a car crash. Rebecca's [second Grumblr post](grumblr2) from November 2036 
mentions this happened a few years before and Dallus is still only half there. Since Ren is alive to 
activate [EVE](../characters/eve) in 2037 according to the [D8 log](lauren_d8_log), the child who died had to have been 
Lyra.
