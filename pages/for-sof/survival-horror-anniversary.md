# Post Human: Survival Horror Tribute

On the 31st of October 2025, an update to the [website](../website/website) was released. A slider puzzle was added to 
the inventory, which looks similar to a sci-fi map.

The puzzle was opened on the same day to reveal a tribute to [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](../music/ph-survival-horror), 
released 5 years ago.

The solution to the slider puzzle above is nearly complete; once you move the bottom right piece up the 
puzzle will unlock. The puzzle is easiest when you start from the top and follows the same rules as other 
slider puzzles.
