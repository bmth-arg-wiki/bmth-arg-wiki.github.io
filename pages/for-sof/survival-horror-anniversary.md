# Post Human: Survival Horror Tribute

On the 31st of October 2025, an update to the [website](../website/website) was released. A slider puzzle was added to 
the inventory, which looks similar to a sci-fi map.

The puzzle was opened on the same day to reveal a tribute to [POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR](../music/ph-survival-horror), 
released 5 years ago.
