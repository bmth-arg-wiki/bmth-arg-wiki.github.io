# Jan15_2031_declassified_PROJECT D.U.S.T. 2

> Our primary objective centers on the development of a potent bioweapon.

This file contains a research proposal from [ARC/HIVE](../music/amo-in-the-dark) 
for several projects. The initial proposal was finished or sent on the 15th of January 2021, 
then the document was declassified by the company re-branded Nex Gen exactly 10 years later in 2031.

The lead scientist on this project was Dr. Elias Mortem, a scientist who was slaughtered in the [Chapel Incident](chapel) 
in 2040, along with their team. Sof even remarks in [their journal](../lore/journal) that this may have been a consequence 
of their research on Project D.U.S.T.

## About

This file was added along the previous issue 51 of Tekka magazine on the 25th of June 2024.
The file contains a research proposal for [several projects](project_dust). The password
was found in an instagram post, where the characters appeared. The last two characters were
switched. Since December 2024, it does not require a password anymore.

> To: [Redacted], Director of Special Projects

>
> Recent examinations of the documents extracted during Operation Trinity have unveiled extraordinary evidence 
> concerning the aptly named Project Kingslayer. Initially spearheaded by Skys and [Redacted], the data indicates 
> the potential to harness dark matter beyond theoretical applications, suggesting a tangible, wieldable force that 
> could revolutionize our understanding of existence.
>
> Skys's research was predicated on the hypothesis that extreme physical and/or psychological torment could facilitate 
> spiritual transcendence. This theory posits that near-death experiences may potentially allow access to hidden 
> dimensions and dark matter manipulation. [Redacted] initial collaboration, though limited, corroborates the 
> existence of previously unrecorded brainwave patterns and visual phenomena under duress.
>
> [Four full lines redacted]
>
> I propose the initiation of Project D.U.S.T. to further explore these findings. Despite the extreme measures 
> inherent in this line of subatomic exploration, it is a field we cannot afford to overlook. Although assurances 
> have been made that October Palace was stripped clean, there is no certainty that this data is not in the possession 
> of others. Should it have fallen into the hands of the Eastern Citadel, it is probable they are already progressing 
> beyond our current capabilities. The potential implications necessitate immediate action. Our primary objective 
> centers on the development of a potent bioweapon. Ethical considerations have been addressed, ensuring that we will 
> exclusively utilize the [Redacted] procured during Operation Trinity. Their anomalous abilities pose a significant 
> threat, making their release a nonviable option. These subjects, exhibiting exceptional yet perilous threats, will 
> be given a second chance at life, turning their inherent danger into a strategic advantage.
>
> **Third Page - Document Continues**
>
> To advance our research, we propose the construction of a Phase 2 Altilium Chordata Tank. This state-of-the-art 
> stasis chamber will allow us to maintain subjects in a state of metabolic stasis, ensuring cellular repair and 
> regeneration while inhibiting the release of endorphins that could otherwise mitigate the objective of the project.
>
> To conclude, success in Project D.U.S.T. could place our nation at the pinnacle of global power, with the 
> ability to deploy biological weapons capable of unprecedented feats. The implications for military strategy and 
> national security are profound, warranting immediate and substantial funding.

> [Sixteen full lines redacted, including a picture of the mentioned tank, exactly like the one seen in the

>
> **P.S.Y**  
> The second request for funding is to aid further research into the innovative potential of Psychoactive Structured 
> Yttrium (P.S.Y.).
>
> Despite the eventual defeat of Mantra, the cult's ability to incapacitate hundreds of troops using advanced 
> psychological tactics remains fascinating. Central to these tactics were the induced psychological hallucinations 
> colloquially referred to as "Mares."
>
> **Fourth Page - Document Continues**
>
> **Mechanisms and Effects of the Mares**  
> The Mares were not mere hallucinations but shared visions that exploited the cognitive architecture of their 
> victims, inducing paralyzing fear. These visions appeared to leverage a shared thread of entities commonly 
> experienced in phenomena such as sleep paralysis, suggesting an underlying neuropsychological connection.
>
> **Anomalous Observations**  
> The reports concerning the "Special Six," who purportedly incapacitated their would-be executors before 
> execution, are of particular interest. Despite our inability to extract reliable accounts from captured Eastern 
> troops, the prevailing theory suggests that these children possess an innate or cultivated proficiency in 
> manipulating an ability similar to that of P.S.Y.
>
> **Cognitive Echoes and Visual Feedback**  
> Our Head of R&D, Dr. Dallus, continues to experience flashbacks of the Mares entities, despite rigorous 
> desensitization protocols. Alarmingly, his youngest daughter, who was born post-operation, manifests these 
> visions as well. This generational transmission suggests a profound and previously unobserved neuropsychological 
> phenomenon, warranting further investigation.
>
> The persistence of these cognitive echoes in both Dr. Dallus and his daughter suggests a form of neural imprinting 
> or genetic transmission. The exact mechanisms remain speculative, but preliminary data indicate a possible 
> epigenetic factor. Further investigation is required to elucidate the pathways and potential for control or 
> amplification.
>
> Attached Visuals: Included in this communication are detailed visuals of the Mares, as well as photocopies of 
> drawings made by Dr. Dallus's daughter, depicting these entities. These materials provide compelling evidence 
> of the generational transmission and underscore the urgent need for continued research in this domain.
>
> **Fifth Page - Document Ends**
>
> **Conclusion**  
> The insights gained from the analysis of Skys and the Cult of Mantra, coupled with the potential applications of 
> Psychoactive Structured Yttrium, present an unprecedented opportunity to enhance our military capabilities. 
> The proposed research and development initiatives warrant immediate and substantial funding to ensure we remain 
> at the forefront of this strategic domain.

## Speculation

![Child's drawings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/inthedark/gallery/l_dallusdaughterdrawings.png)

- The drawings seen from the girl in ["In The Dark"](../music/amo-in-the-dark) indicate we might see his daughter(s) there. Dallas' child is actually [Ren](../characters/ren), 
a trans man.
- The document speaks about "the special six", which may be the children we see in 
the official [Kool-Aid](../music/song-koolaid) music video.

![altilium chordata tank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/music/amo/inthedark/gallery/f_altiliumchordatatank.png)

The altilium chordata tank appears in ["In The Dark"](../music/amo-in-the-dark).
