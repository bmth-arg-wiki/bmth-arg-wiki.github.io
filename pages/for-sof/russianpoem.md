# дорогая моя любовь.doc

> "In the silence of the palace, a moonbeam shines through the windows"

This file was unlocked on the 30th of June 2024, after being released 
on the 7th of June. "дорогая моя любовь" roughly translates to "my dear love".

Sof estimates the date of the letter to be between 2004 and 2020, specifically referring to the years
[Skys & the Starjammers](skystarjammers) played at October Palace and the year of [Operation Trinity](trinity_document) 
and the fall of the [MANTRA cult](../lore/mantra). 

This lines up with the affair between [Strassman](../characters/strassman) and [Ava](../characters/ava) and 
[Unbeleevable Episode 3](../for-sof/unbeleevable3) confirms this letter was sent by the scientist. The pair 
met at October Palace at a concert from [Skys & the Starjammers](skystarjammers) in 2004.
Sadly, [Dallus' diary](dallus-diary) reveals that Ava did not make it out of the [Mantra cult](../lore/mantra) 
alive.

## Transcription

### Original

> В тиши дворца, Светит лунной луч сквозь окна, В тайне тихо я плачу...
> 
> В мраморных залах пустых, Меж теней и шепотов, Слова мои опасны
>
> В тот день, когда мы встретились лунный свет касался нас
>
> Твоя улыбкаа - звезда, твоей смех - светлый луч , В лабиринте снов моих,
>
> не знаешь ты меня хорошо,
>
> Но знак тебе дарю, хочешь увидеть меня, найди меня на улице.  Твой взгляд в толпе, мое сердце помнить не может.
>
> Твой образ - мой ночной свет. Читай мой тайный друг, в этих стихах любовь и тайна живут

### Translated

> In the silence of the palace,
> A moonbeam shines through the windows,
> In secret I cry quietly...
>
> In the empty marble halls,
> Between shadows and whispers,
> My words are dangerous
>
> On the day when we met,
> the moonlight touched us
>
> Your smile is a star, your laughter is a bright ray,
> In the labyrinth of my dreams,
>
> You don't know me well,
>
> But I give you a sign, if you want to see me, find me on the street.
> Your gaze in the crowd, my heart cannot remember.
>
> Your image is my night light.
> Read my secret friend, in these verses love and mystery live.
