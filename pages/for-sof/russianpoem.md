# дорогая моя любовь.doc

> "In the silence of the palace, a moonbeam shines through the windows"

This file was unlocked on the 30th of June 2024, after being released 
on the 7th of June. "дорогая моя любовь" roughly translates to "my dear love".

Sof estimates the date of the letter to be between 2004 and 2020, specifically referring to the years
[Skys & the Starjammers](skystarjammers) played at October Palace and the year of [Operation Trinity](trinity_document) 
and the fall of the [MANTRA cult](../lore/mantra).

In Unbeleevable 2 we learn about a woman [Strassman](../characters/strassman) fell in love with named Ava, 
but [Dallus' diary](dallus-diary), written at ARC/HIVE after Operation Trinity on the 19th of January 2021, tells us that she died. 
They met at October Palace at the Skys & the Starjammers concert. This makes Ava a likely candidate to be 
the receiver of this letter, but this has not been confirmed.

## About

This file was originally released as `Russian_poem.DOC`, along with [Unbeleevable](unbeleevable) and 
the [Skys & The Starjammers poster](skystarjammers). The password
for this was found in an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-DhcBaC4NP/).

More context was provided in December 2024, when a website
update dropped [Sof](../characters/sof)'s thoughts on the matter in their [journal](../lore/journal).

## Transcription

### Original

> В тиши дворца, Светит лунной луч сквозь окна, В тайне тихо я плачу...
> 
> В мраморных залах пустых, Меж теней и шепотов, Слова мои опасны
>
> В тот день, когда мы встретились лунный свет касался нас
>
> Твоя улыбкаа - звезда, твоей смех - светлый луч , В лабиринте снов моих,
>
> не знаешь ты меня хорошо,
>
> Но знак тебе дарю, хочешь увидеть меня, найди меня на улице.  Твой взгляд в толпе, мое сердце помнить не может.
>
> Твой образ - мой ночной свет. Читай мой тайный друг, в этих стихах любовь и тайна живут

### Translated

> In the silence of the palace,
> A moonbeam shines through the windows,
> In secret I cry quietly...
>
> In the empty marble halls,
> Between shadows and whispers,
> My words are dangerous
>
> On the day when we met,
> the moonlight touched us
>
> Your smile is a star, your laughter is a bright ray,
> In the labyrinth of my dreams,
>
> You don't know me well,
>
> But I give you a sign, if you want to see me, find me on the street.
> Your gaze in the crowd, my heart cannot remember.
>
> Your image is my night light.
> Read my secret friend, in these verses love and mystery live.
