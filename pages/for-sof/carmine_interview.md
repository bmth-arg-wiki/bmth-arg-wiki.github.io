# Reconstructed Carmine Interview

> Medea. Her head detonated, remember? Some say you sent your own kid into that death cult, just to extract a few dangerous minds.

A mysterious butterfly appeared on the [website](../website/website) on the 21st of August 2025. Behind the 
butterfly is a transmission. The contents of this transmission are a reconstruction of an interview with 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), head of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), eventually re-branding
to [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) after an incident called the "Cradle Crash".

The interview was recovered by someone who also left notes, signing them only as "L".

## About

The file was released on the 21st of August. At the moment, four tabs have been unlocked: prologue, intro and 
two interview pages.

While the first two tabs are unlocked, the other three tabs require a password. All of these passwords are hidden behind a 
cipher. The third puzzle is not currently unlocked.

> First Note - Prologue (yellow text)
> Skys... This interview was conducted shortly after the public collapse of Arc/Hive.. what the net calls 
> 'The Cradle Crash.' You were right. Arc/Hive was never dismantled. Victor simply rebranded. New logo, Same bones. 
> They call it NEX GEN now (subtle, considering everything you said went down) This appears to be Carmine's attempt to 
> 'regain the narrative.' This is the only known transcript of an unsanctioned interview with the (currently) unknown 
> journalist. I found it in a wormed-out telemetry packet riding a dead network node in West Kraava. Rebuilding this has 
> been... tricky. Nearly all of the conversation's been buried under multi-threaded sigdust. A few segments are 
> corrupted beyond recovery. Still, I've stitched together what I could. Reconstruction was made possible using:
>
> Glass Reflection Echo Capture (GREC-R1 array)
>
> Biometric Vector Stenography (via dormant ambient chair-embedded sensors)
>
> GPT-M4 Hallucination Containment (3.9% drift per line)
>
> Neural Lip-Sync Predictive Filling (OpenFace++ + Whisper fallback model)

> Audio De-glitch through QRipple-9 Residuals
