# Reconstructed Carmine Interview

> Medea. Her head detonated, remember? Some say you sent your own kid into that death cult, just to extract a few dangerous minds.

A mysterious butterfly appeared on the [website](../website/website) on the 21st of August 2025. Behind the 
butterfly is a transmission. The contents of this transmission are a reconstruction of an interview with 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), head of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), eventually re-branding
to [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) after an incident called the "Cradle Crash".

The interview was recovered by someone who also left notes, signing them only as "L".
