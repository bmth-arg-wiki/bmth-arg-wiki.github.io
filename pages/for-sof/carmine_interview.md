# Reconstructed Carmine Interview

> Medea. Her head detonated, remember? Some say you sent your own kid into that death cult, just to extract a few dangerous minds.

A mysterious butterfly appeared on the [website](../website/website) on the 21st of August 2025. Behind the 
butterfly is a transmission. The contents of this transmission are a reconstruction of an interview with 
[Victor Carmine](../characters/victor-carmine), head of [Arc/Hive](../lore/archive), that eventually re-branded
to [Nex Gen](../lore/nex-gen-corporation) after an incident called the "Cradle Crash".

The interview was recovered by someone who also left notes, signing them only as "L".

> Skys... This interview was conducted shortly after the public collapse of Arc/Hive.. what the net calls 
> 'The Cradle Crash.' You were right. Arc/Hive was never dismantled. Victor simply rebranded. New logo, Same bones. 
> They call it NEX GEN now (subtle, considering everything you said went down) This appears to be Carmine's attempt to 
> 'regain the narrative.' This is the only known transcript of an unsanctioned interview with the (currently) unknown 
> journalist. I found it in a wormed-out telemetry packet riding a dead network node in West Kraava. Rebuilding this has 
> been... tricky. Nearly all of the conversation's been buried under multi-threaded sigdust. A few segments are 
> corrupted beyond recovery. Still, I've stitched together what I could. Reconstruction was made possible using:
>
> Glass Reflection Echo Capture (GREC-R1 array)
>
> Biometric Vector Stenography (via dormant ambient chair-embedded sensors)

> GPT-M4 Hallucination Containment (3.9% drift per line)

> [CARMINE:] 'Uh-oh. We got a Reality Paradoxer on our hands.'
>
> [Reaches over. Grabs tablet. Grip: firm but playful. Pupil dilation: predator baseline.]
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
> 
> [Quick reflex. Swipes back.]

>
> [CARMINE:]
>

>
> [Lets go. Leans back.]
>
> Chair sync pulse: calm. No fight. Just focus.
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Clears throat. Vocal tremor: micro-shake, hidden resolve underneath.]
>
> 'Well, the idea that reality isn't a straight line, that we're all caught in an endless cycle of rebirth and failure, 
> a loop, trapped by our own lack of evolution. That there's no future for humanity, only repeat patterns. 
> Let's just say, sometimes, I can relate.'
>
> [Eye contact: held. Truth vector: 87.3% match.]
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Raises opposite eyebrow. Casual symmetry - predatory interest.]
> 
> 'Relate, huh?'
>
> Pause. Head tilt: inquisitive. Smile: faint but active.
>
> 'It's not that we're doomed to an endless cycle of failure because we lack evolution. 
> It's because we're playing a game we don't even know we're in.'
>
> [Voice shift: philosophical register. Vocal depth drops 12db - subdued reverence.]
> 
> [CARMINE:] 'Maybe this world isn't the end. Maybe it's just a checkpoint.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Leans forward. Breathing irregular.]
>
> 'You've seen it, haven't you?'
>
> (Whispers)
>
> 'The cave paintings in the Valkhan caves, the ones in the deserts of Dravada? They foretell everything. 
> The fall of humanity. It's been written in the scriptures for millennia.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Eyes flare. Iris swirl detected - subconscious signal bloom.]
>
> 'The seven nights of darkness. The time where the world will descend into chaos to pave the way for a saviour.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Nods. Voice accelerates.]
>
> 'It's in almost every ancient text, across multiple cultures. In Sanskrit, it speaks of a great purification.
>
> [JOURNALIST:] In Zoroastrianism, they talk about the Frashokereti.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Voice lowers. Monastic cadence.]
>
> 'In our greed, we created our own hell. Our personal Gehenna. But there's another world. A world that remains pure. 
> We lost touch with it long ago.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:] 'Seven nights of suffering to pave the way, and the Post Human - the one who will rise from the ashes, 
> the prophesied lilac-skinned Demi-God, born to overcome the four trials of the earthly elements. Earth, water, fire, 
> and air.'
>
> [CARMINE:] 'It's all symbolic, I'll give you that.'
>
> [eyes unfocused - slow drift into interior world.]
>
> 'The elements. The purification. They're about rebirth, destruction, and creation.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [shifts. Intrigue level rising. Pulse spike: +9.4 bpm.]
>
> 'Those paintings in Dravada... they show these trials. The earth split in two. Skies set ablaze. Floods swallowing cities. 
> But there's something else. Something about a great plague that will cleanse the world.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
> 
> [Expression hardens. Jaw locks. Voice: flat, final.]
>
> 'It's not just a story.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Pushes forward.]
> 
> 'These true gods, the ones the paintings depict - what do you know about them? You have to know something more. 
> You're telling me all this for a reason.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> 'You could say I've seen things.'
>
> [Eye twitch. Thumb rubs palm subconsciously - suppressed memory pattern.]
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> 'Ancient texts. Patterns across history. The Post Human prophecy is just part of it. But the truth?'
>
> [Leans in. Voice drops to 43hz - untraceable beneath base ambient hum.]
>
> 'The truth is... there is no planet B, but there might be a reality B. We're not just talking about rebirth in a spiritual sense. 
> It's literal.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Heartbeat spike. Brow tightens. Vocal cord tension increases.]
>
> 'Y-93.'
>
> Whispers. Shivers.
>
> 'The pure world.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Nods.]
>
> 'Elysium. Hyperspace. Whatever you want to call it. Strassman and his team... 
> they're not just exploring the mind - they're exploring another reality. It's all connected. The prophecies. The trials. 
> The dimensions we can't perceive in our waking world. The Post Human isn't just a metaphor for evolution. It's real.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Clutches tablet. Skull-ache spike registered. Oxygen flow in brain: reduced.]
>
> 'You seriously believe that?'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Smiles. No teeth. Quiet.]
>
> 'Belief is irrelevant. We're on the brink of something humanity's been preparing for, for millennia. 
> DMT is helping us uncover things we never knew... that's for sure.'
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Swallows. Throat strain detected.]
>
> 'Seriously, how can you let me walk out of here after dropping all this on me? You know how this plays out. 
> You start talking about things like alternate realities, DMT doorways, and some Post Human saviour... 
> Your stock's going to plummet even lower. Investors will panic. Shareholders will jump ship. I'm not naive. 
> This kind of talk has real consequences. You can't expect to throw this out there without it coming back to bite you.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Expression softens. Father-simulacrum engaged.]
>
> 'Like I said... I'm a changed man.'
>
> [Smile. Mischief in eye flare. Caught off guard signal.]
>
> [JOURNALIST:]
>
> [Giggles. Attempts suppression. Fails.]
>
> Glance down. Bite lip. Emotional integrity fracture: detected. Looks up. Eye contact established.
>
> Shared gaze: held. Heat bloom: mutual.
>
> [DOOR BURSTS OPEN]
>
> [ASSISTANT:]
>
> [Face pale. Vocal tremor index: +34.7%]
>
> 'S-sir... I'm sorry to interrupt, but something has happened. Something that requires your immediate attention.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Glare. Jaw flex.]
>
> 'What is it?'
>
> [Growl tone: 46% measured, 54% venom.]
>
> [ASSISTANT:]
>
> 'It would be better to discuss in private, sir.'
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> 'What you can say to me, you can say to her.'
>
> [JOURNALIST: turns. Alert. Fully present.]
>
> [ASSISTANT:] 'S-sir, I honestly thi-'
>
> [CARMINE:] 'Just tell me.'
>
> [Winks - microgesture. Meant as cue.]
>
> [ASSISTANT:]
>
> [Fails to process. Overridden by fear loop.]
>
> 'It's regarding planet HIP's response to the ADAM chatbot, the one Dr. Lauren was working on decoding before we 
> scrambled his brain with that neural excavation. Well, Ren... w-who you convinced to pick up where his father left 
> off after he died, completely clueless that we're the reason his dad ended up catatonic… he's finalised the blueprints. 
> It's some kind of Æ, light years beyond the grasp of our current understanding. She claims to be the salvation of mankind. 
> She's in Ren's lab. And she... s-she wants to talk to you.'
>
> [Room temp: drops. Silence logged. Smartglass goes matte.]
>
> [CARMINE:]
>
> [Sighs. Rubs temples.]

> [ENTRY: frontal lobe | EXIT: none | DEATH: instantaneous]
> 
> [JOURNALIST'S BODY: Slumps forward. Impact pressure: +7kg desk load]

> [CARMINE:] 'Shame. We were just starting to hit it off.'
>
> [Sets gun down. Calm. Controlled detachment.]
> 
> [ASSISTANT: Pulse spike. Near syncope.]
>
> [CARMINE:]
> 
> [Jacket. Collar fix.]
>
> 'Let's go meet her, shall we?'
>
> [Bright green text:] Æ has entered the chat.

> [Fifth Note (yellow text):]

> Skys...
>
> She caught a glimpse of the truth last time. Cold War cover-ups. Alien signals. 
> A war that broke Carmine's body and buried his family. The 'woman in the sky.' 
> What you're about to read wasn't meant for public record. 
> I only reconstructed it because the smart glass reflection hit an echo loop from Carmine's own eyes. 
> This is where it shifts.
