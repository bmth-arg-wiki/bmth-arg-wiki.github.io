> TRIBUTE TO THE FIRST AND LAST SHADOW, ALFGRAM, THE SEER
>
> “Let it be written in the dust of all realms: the way is torn open by the hand of Alfgram, First Shadow, whose vision 
> bore the Unseen, whose path of pain beckons those who seek forbidden truths. O you who shattered the veil, you who walked 
> through ruin to see beyond flesh, your suffering laid bare in the path.”

> ### Pages 5 & 6
> Passage I: Hymn of the Veiled Goddess
> 
> O Keeper of Shadows, we call upon you not with words of lips but of spirit. In silence lies thunder, in your whisper, every fear resounds.
>
> O Belmic Mother, She-Who-Guards, To you, we bring flesh as our offering, our wounds as psalms.
>
> May we be sundered as you sunder, torn to the marrow. For in pain we find the road, and in suffering, we find the key.
>
> [Faded colourful drawing]

> ### Pages 7 & 8
> Passage II: The Way of Shadows
>
> (As recorded by Ramu-Os, Disciple of the First Eclipse)
>
> 1:1 Thus spoke Alfgram: “The flesh blinds the spirit, but pain is the fire that purifies. Agony carves truth. Only by the wound does the cage of flesh crack, and in that breaking, we glimpse the void within.”
>
> 1:3 Alfgram looked upon the willing, saying, “The false world deceives, for comfort is the snare binding the spirit to illusion. Only by blood do we see past the shadows.”
>
> [Abstract colourful drawing]

> ### Pages 9 & 10
> Passage III: The Doctrine of the Void
> (As Narrated by Heresh, Keeper of the Scarlet Manuscript)
>
> 2:1 And Alfgram, the Seer, turned from the light as one turns to the balm of night, for the light hides and the dark reveals.
> 
> 2:3 “Only through the eclipse can the true spirit emerge, raw and unadorned, stripped of illusion.”
> 
> 2:5 And the Belmic Goddess whispered until, “In your breaking, I shall know you, and in your agony, I shall be with you. Walk through fires of suffering, strip from yourself all comfort, and I shall reveal the shadow that is my face.”
>

> Passage IV: The Trial of Suffering
>
> (The Words of Seb-Na, Disciple of Pain)
>
> 3:1 Seb-Na, having endured the Rite of Flesh, spoke to the faithful, “The path is a razor, and we who walk it cut away all falsehood. Let no soul seek solace, for solace binds. Seek the scar, for through it, the spirit ascends.”
>
> 3:3 Alfgram taught, “Pain is the key, and suffering the vessel. Let each wound be a mark upon the soul, a passage into the unknown. For only the wounded see beyond.
>
> [Right page:]
>
> Hymn of the Shattered Veil
>
> O Darkness, that binds the soul,
>
> We see you through wounds and grief,
>
> In agony, we glimpse your face. O Belmic Mother,
>
> She-Who-Calls,
>
> Wrap us in your hollow light,
>
> Blessed is the wound that cannot heal.

> ### Pages 13 & 14
> [Abstract colourful drawing]
>
> Passage V: The Testament of Skys and the Coming of Alfgram
>
> (Words of Ja-Roth, from the Scarlet Tablets)
>
> 5:1 In the age when the moon was shadowed and stars hid, there came forth Skys, born of dusk and flame, leading the lost through agony.
>
> 5:3 Yet it was not Skys who bore the true path, but Alfgram, tempered by ruin. For Skys turned from purity, seeking dominion where none was to be found.

> ### Pages 15 & 16
> [Abstract colourful drawing]
>
> Passage VI: The Splintering of the Eclipse
>
> (As recorded by Nehem-Aru, Scribe of the Hollow Night)
>
> 6:1 And Alfgram spoke, “Skys, you have strayed from the path. You seek mastery, but mastery is illusion, a chain binding the spirit.”
>
> 6:5 So the faithful who were pure departed, leaving Skys to his palace of dust, while Alfgram walked into shadow,
> leading the true on the path of the eclipse.

> ### Pages 17 & 18
> [Abstract colourful drawing]
>
> Passage VII: The Seven Trials of the Ecliptic Path
>
> (As told by Hara-Nash, Disciple of the First Mark)
>
> 7:1 The Trials of Silence – “Be still, for only in silence does the soul speak its true voice.”
>
> 7:3 The Trial of Blood – “Cut away the ties of flesh, for only in blood does the spirit emerge.”
>
> 7:5 The Trial of Darkness – “Face the void within, for fear is the veil that hides the shadow.”
>
> 7:7 The Trial of Fire – “Endure the flame, for in its heat, the soul is made pure.”

> ### Pages 19 & 20
> [Abstract drawing]
>
> Passage VIII: The Hymn of the Eclipse
>
> For we who are touched by Alfgram,
>
> Sing of the darkness that cleanses.
>
> From the wound comes truth,
>
> From agony, we rise as one.
>
> We are the children of pain,
>
> Marked by the shadow of the Unseen.

> ### Pages 21 & 22
> [Abstract drawing]
>
> Passage IX: The Prophecy of the Eternal Shadow
>
> (Words of Ra-Tal, Keeper of the Last Vision)
>
> 8:9 “In the days of the final eclipse, the shadow shall consume the false light, and those who bear the mark shall stand unbound by flesh.”
>
> 8:12 Alfgram spoke, “Fear not the darkness, for in it lies truth unuttered. Hold to the path of agony, for through it, the spirit transcends.”
>
> “In the shadow of agony, we ascend.”

> ### Pages 23 & 24
> Passage X: The Calling of Alfgram
>
> The Origins of the Faithful (Alfgram 1:1 – 1:8)
>
> 1:1 In the age when stars hid their faces, there arose a prophet, known by the name of Skys, born under omens dark and dire. In his blood ran the hue of nightfall, and his hair bore the red stain of prophecy.
>
> 1:3 Skys spoke of liberation beyond flesh, calling out to those who walked the path of suffering. He declared himself the way to transcendence,
> for in his words were visions of realms unseen, and in his voice, the promise of freedom.
>
> 1:6 Yet Skys knew that the journey could not be walked alone. He sought one who knew the ways of pain, tempered in agony and pure of spirit. From the lands of Sovia, a man named Alfgram came forth, bearing within him the light of unbreakable devotion.
>
> 1:8 Alfgram beheld Skys and gave him his pledge, swearing his hands to the work, his soul to the trials, and his flesh to the altar of suffering. For in Skys, he saw not just a prophet, but the path to a kingdom beyond all pain, a place where the soul would stand unbound by flesh.

> ### Pages 25 & 26
> Passage XI: The Forge of October
>
> The Trials of the Faithful (Skys 2:1 – 2:7)
>
> 2:1 They gathered in October Palace, a temple of stone and suffering, where light was a rare stranger, and the air bore the iron tang of blood. Here, the followers were stripped of worldly comfort, molded through trials of fire and shadow. For it was said, “Only in suffering does truth emerge.”
>
> 2:4 Alfgram lay upon the altar, his flesh marked by sacred scars, his spirit tempered like steel. And he endured, for he saw in pain a doorway, a glimpse into the hidden realms of truth.
>
> 2:7 Yet, as the rituals grew darker, Alfgram saw that Skys’s gaze began to waver. The prophet, once pure, took counsel in shadows with those whose eyes glinted with hidden ambition, and Alfgram’s heart grew heavy, for he saw the birth of pride within Skys.

> ### Pages 27 & 28
> Passage XII: The Fall of Skys
>
> The Lament of Alfgram (Alfgram 3:1 – 3:5)
>
> 3:1 Alfgram, clothed in purity, rose before the followers and spoke with the voice of thunder, saying, “He who walks the way of darkness must not stumble, for his fall shall lead others astray. Skys, once our light, now wears a shroud of pride and seeks dominion over truth.”
>
> 3:3 Thus did Alfgram confront Skys, standing before him as an iron pillar, unbending before the prophet he had once revered. 
> And he declared, “You, Skys, have turned from purity. Your heart is weighed down by ambition, and your path leads not to truth but to corruption.”
>
> 3:5 Skys, wounded by Alfgram’s words, raged in his pride, for he knew in his heart that his disciple spoke the truth. But pride once tasted becomes a poison, and Skys turned from his brother, seeing him now as a foe to his path.
>
> [Abstract drawing, but figures can be seen at the bottom of it]

> ### Pages 29 & 30
>
> [The slide shows Passage VI again, but clicking the magnifying glass reveals Passage XIII:]
>
> Passage XIII: The Sundering of Paths
> The Birth of Ecliptism (The Faithful 4:1 – 4:5)
>
> 4:1 And so, in the stone halls of October Palace, Alfgram and the pure of heart departed, severing the bond that bound them to Skys. They walked away from his shadow, seeking the path of suffering in purity. These became the Ecliptics, those who embraced the darkness beyond light.
>
> 4:3 Alfgram spoke to his followers, saying, “Pain is the chisel of the spirit, the fire that purifies. Seek not comfort, for it binds the spirit. Seek the shadow, for in it lies the face of the true.”
>
> 4:5 They called him the First Shadow, the Shepherd of Suffering, for he had seen through Skys’s illusions and brought his people to the true path.

> ### Pages 30 & 31
> Passage XIV: The Wrath of Skys
>
> The Hunt of the Faithful (Skys 5:1 – 5:6)
>
> 5:1 When Skys awoke to find Alfgram and the faithful gone, he felt a wound as deep as mortal pain. His heart, consumed by rage, could not bear the sting of betrayal nor the truth that lingered in their absence.
>
> 5:3 He summoned those loyal to him, speaking words laced with venom: “Alfgram is no brother of ours, but a heretic, a soul misled. None shall defy my path and live. His heresy shall be erased from this world.”
>
> 5:6 And so he sent forth his disciples to hunt the Ecliptics, to cast down those who had forsaken his light for the purity of shadow.

> ### Pages 31 & 32
> Passage XV: The Reckoning of Flesh
>
> The Shadowed Grove (The Pure 6:1 – 6:7)
>
> 6:1 Alfgram and his followers found refuge in hidden groves and caves, where shadows wrapped around them 
> like a cloak. Here, they prepared their souls, for Alfgram had seen in visions that Skys would not relent 
> until all who followed him lay in dust.
>
> 6:4 When Skys and his loyalists arrived, they stood across from the Ecliptics, divided by the chasm of 
> truth and pride. Alfgram net Skys’s gaze, and in the silence, they both knew what lay between them: 
> a brotherhood, shattered by pride and ambition.
>
> 6:7 Skys spoke first, his voice lash, saying, “Bow to me, Alfgram, and mercy may yet be yours,” 
> But Alfgram’s voice wad steady. “You are lost, Skys, a slave to the very illusions we sought to destroy. I 
> bow to no false prophet. Death is but a door, and I shall walk unharmed.”
>
> [Abstract faded drawing]

> ### Pages 33 & 34
> Passage XVI: The Ascension of Alfgram
>
> The Death of the Flesh (The First Shadow 7:1 – 7:8)
>
> 7:1. And so, in the fury of battle, Alfgram and Skys clashed, their conflict a war of flesh and spirit, of truth and pride. Skys fought with fury, but Alfgram bore the calm of one already beyond
>
> 7:4 As the final blow fell, Alfgram’s body lay upon the earth, his spirit rising like smoke from embers, His followers gathered around him, reaching as though the light of a dying star.
>
> 7:8 And with his last breath, Alfgram spoke, “In suffering, I am free; in shadow, I find light. Seek the darkness, for it is the face of all truth.” And thus did Alfgram ascend beyond flesh, his spirit a beacon to faithful.

> ### Pages 35 & 36
> Passage XVII: The Hymn of Alfgram
>
> The Song of Suffering (The First Shadow 8:1 – 8:8)
>
> 8:1 And the faithful mourned, yet within their hearts, they carried the knowledge that Alfgram’s spirit walked in unseen realms. 
> They whispered his name in darkness and sang of him in hidden places, their voices like prayers to the First Shadow.
>
> 8:5 They sang hymns not of comfort but of fierce resolve, hymns that echoed through the caves, each line a prayer of loyalty to Alfgram, the Shepherd in Darkness.
>
> 8:8 For they walked the path of suffering, knowing that only through shadow could they see the light beyond flesh.
>
> [Faded drawing of hooded figures]

> ### Pages 37 & 38
> Passage XVIII: The Seven Trials of Purity
>
> The Path of Wounds (Faithful 9:1 – 9:5)
>
> 9:1 In honor of Alfgram’s teachings, the faithful established the Seven Trials of Purity, rites that stripped the soul of lies and left only truth. For the Ecliptics knew that only in agony could one find freedom.
>
> 9:2 The First Trial is Silence, for only in stillness can the voice of truth be heard. The Second Trial is Blood, for the flesh must be shed to reveal the spirit. The Third Trial is Hunger, for true sustenance lies in the soul, not the earth.
>
> 9:5 And so those who endured the trials became Children of the Eclipse, marked with scars that told their passage through the shadows, each scar a sign of their purity and devotion.
>

> ### Pages 39 & 40
> Passage XIX: The Hymn of Shadows
>
> The Song of the Faithful (Psalms of the Eclipse 10:1 – 10:4)
>
> 10:1 O Shepherd of Suffering, guide us to the flame,
> Where flesh is but a veil, and pain reveals the Name.
> In agony, we find you, in darkness, your light.
>
> 10:4 Lead us, Alfgram, through fire and storm,
> To the truth beyond truth, where the spirit is born.
