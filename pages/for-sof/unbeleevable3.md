### Trailer

Before the original video dropped, a premiere was uploaded to YouTube with a trailer.

> UNBELEEVABLE EP 3 TRAILER - [DO NOT MAKE PUBLIC]
> Lee [to his editor who’s facing away from the camera]: “Reyt, let’s get these scenes sorted out now. We need to cut in here quicker and then stay in that bit for a bit longer alreyt. You fxcking useless twat.”
>
> Lee [now to the camera]: “Ey up, suppose you’re wondering where I’ve been and why it’s took us so long to get this next episode of unbeLEEvable out. Well, truth is our last editor Barry, he’s dead. Death by scotch egg. So, I’ve enlisted help from this plonker.”
>
> Editor who is actually the man who doesn’t know who he is or where he’s been: “Who am i? Where am i?”
>
> Lee: “Found him talking to a fax machine. Anyway, it’s picking up now he’s not editing on Microsoft Paint, and episode 3 is nearly here. And if you’re sat on your fat stinky arse wondering what this knobhead’s on a bout, then where’ve you been? Cos while you bellends have been watching videos of people eating dish washer tablets, we’ve been investigating the Bring Me The Horizon: POST HUMAN world. There’s two full episodes of unbeLEEvable already out, go and watch them, catch up with what’s happening, I’ll wait here.
>
> “Actually I won’t wait, cos I know you won’t even bother watching them. Cos you kids today lose interest faster than a fart on a rollercoaster. ‘Ooh it’s longer than 30 seconds, can’t I split-screen it with someone doing parkour over a Spanish omelette?’ Grow up.
>
> “I started this show to expose the cult of GENXSIS; a bunch of sandal-sniffing psycopaths run by a sentient AI knobhead called E.V.E, who’s now the big cheese at techno mega corp NEX GEN, conducting freaky little science projects across the globe. But to understand how NEX GEN came to be, we’ve got to wind it right back, back to a shithole called Novosovia, after WW3 turned it into an ashtray.
>
> “From that nuclear skid mark comes a little lad called Skys. This pink-haired plonker falls in with some proper odd balls, starts making music, and somehow becomes a full-blown icon. Imagine Charles Manson if he were even more of a tosspot. But Skys isn’t your average rockstar, hes talking some reyt bollocks: sleep demons, psychological warfare, and even sex magic. And while that might sound like a load of shit to us, Skys starts gaining interest from the scientific world.
>
> “At some point, Skys meets up with two scientists: Dr. Karl Strassman and Dr. Dallus Lauren. These eggheads seem to be buying what Skys is selling, and they join forces. Together, they start a new spiritual science movement called the Cult of Mantra. And this is where things go really tits up. They start blending quantum physics and mysticism like it’s a fxcking strawberry Nesquik. But the science projects go too far. Basically torturing people just shy of death to open the third eye or some bollocks.
>
> “Things get proper messy when Strassman starts shagging Skys’ prize side piece [with a British A pronunciation] Ava.”
>
> Man who doesn’t know who he is or where he’s been [with an American A pronunciation]: “Ava.”
>
> Lee [correcting himself]: “Ava. But the public, they’re bloody loving it. Skys starts healing people, getting the youth of Novosovia off their tits on drugs and turning them against the Novosovian government. Next thing you know he’s not just an icon, he’s a bloody saviour.
>
> “So, how do you bring down a cult leader that thinks he’s God? The same way you do with any man: a lovely lady. God… And that takes us reyt up to episode 3. So get ready and tune in, cos this is about to get unbeLEEvable.”
>
> Lee [to the man who doesn’t know who he is or where he’s been]: “you watching them monkeys again?”
>
> [STAY TUNED]

### Official Video

> 
> [Community Resource Analog Programming intro screen]
> 
> Lee: “Every picture tells a story, but some stories are better off left undeveloped. You see, despite the 
> negative press, things are really starting to click into place for Skys and his cult. But now, Medea is in the 
> frame. Soon, the raw, unfiltered truth will be exposed. So, before it all becomes a blur, let’s focus on the bigger 
> picture. But be warned, this one’s turning into something dark… Room.”
>
> [Unbeleevable intro]
>
> Lee: “They say behind every great man is a woman cleaning up his mess! Now, while I find that viewpoint sexist, 
> I can also tell you, it’s not entirely true. Cos some girls just want to start shit. And this little lady is about to 
> come it and lay a hot stinking trout right on the rug.
>
> “Meet Medea, Skys’ first true love and future mother to two of his supposedly many offspring. Player… For Skys, it 
> was love at first sight, but sometimes love is the knife that cuts the deepest, leaving eternal wounds that bleed 
> into the shadows of your existence. [Sniffles] Belinda you b*tch…
>
> “It’s 2015, and the cult of MANTRA is poppin off. Their influence is spreading like crabs around a rough bird’s pubes, 
> and despite the scientist’s concerns over Skys’ batshit project KINGSLAYER, they were allegedly breaking new ground 
> in the neo-spiritual world. Whatever that is. With some slap-head called Alfgram acting as patient zero. 
> I just spat then. Leaked audio caught on tape reveals Alfgram boasting that he can wield dark energies and traverse 
> into different realities. Honestly, where do they find them?
>
> [Tape player clicks]
>
> [Leaked audio:]
>
> Alfgram: “I am a master of entering voids no other man could. Reality has a backdoor, you simply need to know 
> how to slide in. It can be painful at first, blackholes may rupture in the process, but it’s all worth it for the eruption of ancient power that can bring even the most experiences men to their knees, begging for release.”
>
> [Leaked audio ends. Cut back to Lee]
>
> Lee [sighing]: “Oh, you dirty get… At least take us out for dinner first.
>
> “As you can imagine, folk weren’t exactly lining up to join Skys’ pain Olympics. So, he cooks up a clever plan, sending out an encrypted message to the disillusioned youth of Novasovia. But here’s the kicker, the message lands in the hands of the wrong secret admirers.”
>
> [Jingle for the next segment of the video: History Time]
>
> Lee [singing the jingle]: “It’s history time! It’s history time… It’s history time!
>
> “As you probably know, our so called land of liberty, the Disunited Territories of Colombia (D.T.C.), have been locked in a cold war with Novasovia for as long as anyone can remember. But after the nuclear exchange, it were us who came off looking like a spanked arse.
>
> “The Sovians? They thrived and turned religion into a fear factory and a cash cow, meanwhile, the D.T.C. decided to go all secular. Led by everyone’s favourite billionaire mob boss: Victor Carmine – head honcho of techno mega-corp ARC/HIVE. I’m telling ya, this guy’s a reyt sod, dirtier than a pair of kegs at a car boot sale.
>
> “Carmine thinks enlightenment can be measured, mapped and replicated. HE really is a true visionary of our times… Not! Like Skys and Strassburg, Victor’s got a stonk on for the idea that humanity can tap into alternate dimensions. I’ll have a sniff of whatever he’s on. So, when they hear Skys is on the hunt for new recruits, they send in Medea, their tastiest agent.
>
> “Her mission, if she chooses to accept it: infiltrate the palace, get in Skys’ trousers, dig up the dirt, and bring this freak show down from the inside, so ARC/HIVE could swoop in and cash in on the chaos. Sounds like a piece of piss, right? Nu-uh. Victor drops Medea reyt in it, forcing her to play the part of Skys’ number one fan girl, all while secretly slipping intel back to Victor through-
-a dodgy codec system. (You bastard…)
>
> “And give that girl an Oscar! She’s playing the part a little too well if you ask me. And soon, she’s not just playing a role, she’s guzzling the white, salty kool-aid. She falls hook, line and stinker for Skys’ charm, and ends up ghost victor to become Skys’ right hand lady. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, things are staring to crack.
>
> “Dallas, Skys’ egg head tech wizard, is growing increasingly distant. He’s no longer buying into the dream and he’s struggling to keep his personal life separate from the chaos. And with the birth of his newborn baby Ren, comes the sobering reality that this place… Is no daycare.
>
> “Then comes Strassman. The poor sod’s balls deep in a meat purse of problems. See, Strassman has got himself a little sidequest. He’s secretly knocking boots with one of Skys’ prized disciples: [with an English accent:] Ava. [with an American accent:] Ava. Some seriously cheddar poems reveal every detail of their sordid affair, including the fact he’s gone and got her up the duff. If Skys ever finds out, Strassman’s a dead man walking.
>
> “But for now at least, Skys is too busy playing hide the sausage with Medea to notice. It’s not too long before he puts a bun in her oven. Honeslty, I don’t know how they get owt done with all this shagging… And that’s when things went proper tits up- [gets interrupted] Yo! What you doing? I’m trying to film here!”
>
> Man who doesn’t know who he is or where he’s been: “Me?”
>
> Lee: “Yeah, you. I’m trying to work!”
>
> Man who doesn’t know who he is or where he’s been: “Where am I? Who am I?”
>
> Lee: “I’ve given you a name! You’re Steven Stallone. Can you go away?”
>
> [Man who doesn’t know who he is or where he’s been (or Steven Stallone) walks away while humming a song]
>
> Lee: “Fxck’n hell… So, as I was saying, it goes proper tits up. One Skys’ inner circle, Thea, drops a reyt bombshell: turns out there’s a Novasovian operative in the cult, sent to bring it down from the inside. Alfgram convinces Skys to make an example out of the traitor, using him as both a test subject and a warning of what happens when you fxck about… Word of caution: what you’re about to hear isn’t for the haint farted.”
>
> [Audio recording of a chainsaw and a man screaming]
>
> Lee [starts eating a sandwich while it plays]: “Oh aye. Not bad.”
>
> [Audio recording ends]
>
> Lee: And that’s when the whole house of cards comes crashing down. Skys has gone too far this time. [With an English accent:] Ava’s begging Strassman to leg it, terrified that her and the kids are going to end up on the chopping block.”
>
> Someone off-camera [with an American accent]: “Ava.”
>
> Lee: “Oh f’ckn hell! Medea is watching in horror, seeing just what happens to traitoress scum. And Dallus, already on his arse, finally snaps. What happens next? Maaaaateee… You’re going to have to tune in next time!”
