# Files

content="This article contains heavy spoilers. A new walkthrough will be added later, since the December 4th 2024 update 
made the previous walkthrough redundant. Of course we will preserve this walkthrough in case you want to visit the old 
website on the wayback machine."
%}

This page provides an overview of all files related to the ARG. Most of them were obtained 
from the [website](../webpage) in the FOR SOF folder, but there are a few exceptions we will discuss.

***

## Inventory documents

Since the December 4th 2024 update, there is now an `inventory` on the [webpage](../webpage). This inventory contains 
four puzzles, which have all been unlocked. This update also included the release of [Dallus' diary](dallus-diary) that
is in the FOR SOF folder.

{% assign page_links = '/pages/for-sof/skys-diary, /pages/for-sof/grumblr2, /pages/for-sof/book-of-eclipse, /pages/for-sof/unbeleevable2, /pages/for-sof/cities-coordinates' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

***

## Event-related Documents

The following documents were obtained at the Nex Gen pop-up shops, where the [wi-fi](../lore/wifi) password 
was also found. The event took place on the 27th and 28th of September 2024 and the documents were obtained on the 27th. 
The USB distributed in the pop-up shops contained the `Chapel.mp4` video, while the physical 
document folders that were handed out and hidden around the shops contained a document about [Selene](../characters/selene)'s 
first visits to [Youtopia](../lore/youtopia).

The chapel document was released on the website for the September 26th pre-update, before disappearing with the Dec. 4th 2024 update; 
while the Selene document was never even put there. They are both considered missing.

{% assign page_links = '/pages/for-sof/selene_youtopia_doc, /pages/for-sof/chapel' | split: ", " %}
{% include page-card-gallery.html links=page_links %}

## FOR SOF

`FOR SOF` is a folder in the ARG that can be accessed on the computer. It is password 
protected and was found on 26-05-2024.

### Unlocked files

These are the files in release order in the folder. Each of them used to need a password to be unlocked, but that feature
was removed with the Dec. 4th 2024 update, making them easily available.

### Placeholders

![Password screen for most files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/old_placeholder.png)

Files used to be hidden behind password screens in the `FOR SOF` folder, but the newest version of the 
website has the user solve the puzzles from the inventory. The placeholder screen displayed above 
is an older screenshot of the website, where each file got a custom password screen in the folder itself.

On the 29th of May 2024, the prompt at the top was changed to "password_?" instead of 
"insight_?".

### Corrupt files

There are currently 88 corrupted files in the folder. There used to be 18, before 
the corrupted files weren't visible for a while in some later updates.
They are all labeled `[CORRUPTED]` 

If you click on any of these, M8 will tell you one of the following phrases:

> "This file is F'd up pretty bad. Don't worry, I can fix anything. Just check back later."

> "Hey, I'm working on these. Come back later."

> "Dude, don't you know what corrupted means? Give me some time!"

![Corrupted files screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/corrupted_files.png)

After the update on 26th May 2024, corrupted files showed the following screen for a few months. In the next version 
corrupted files could still be scrolled to using the arrow keys, before the corrupted files seemingly disappeared from 
the folder. After the overhaul in December 2024, corrupt files now don't display a screen and only trigger a voiceline from 
[M8](../m8).

After the May 30th 2024 update, the corrupted files became visible again, this time 
with arrows buttons and page numbers 1-5.
