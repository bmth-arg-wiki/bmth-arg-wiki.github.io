# FOR SOF

{% include info.html
title="Beware spoilers!"
icon="fa-solid fa-lock-open"
content="This article contains heavy spoilers, unlike our [walkthrough](../walkthrough/walkthrough)!"
%}

`FOR SOF` is a folder in the ARG that can be accessed on the computer. It is password 
protected and was found on 26-05-2024. It requires a password.

M8 says "You have 132 documents and one audio log" when you open the folder. This doesn't 
match the contents of what we see (at least not yet).

## Unlocked files

This table contains two links: the filename links to a relevant article (if there is one), the folder icon will bring 
you to the known information (including password) about the file itself.

## Locked files

`Recovered_Chapel.MP4` was added on 26/09, the password is still unknown. Due to 
developments around the pop up shops and the wi-fi password we are currently waiting.

These files currently all use [placeholder](#placeholders) screens.

## Placeholders

![Password screen for most files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/old_placeholder.png)

When the website updates, new password screens are introduced for files, indicating that 
they can now be unlocked. The specific screens will show the number of characters to input, 
as well as any spaces. Evidence strongly suggests that files can not be unlocked before new 
updates have occurred, although this has not been confirmed by the devs.

As of 29/05/2024, the prompt at the top has been changed to "password_?" instead of 
"insight_?".

***

### Corrupt files

There are currently 88 corrupted files in the folder. There used to be 18, before 
the corrupted files weren't visible for a while in some later updates.
They are all labeled `[CORRUPTED]` 

If you click on any of these, M8 will tell you one of the following phrases:

> "This file is F'd up pretty bad. Don't worry, I can fix anything. Just check back later."

> "Hey, I'm working on these. Come back later."

> "Dude, don't you know what corrupted means? Give me some time!"

![Corrupted files screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/corrupted_files.png)

After the update on 26/05/2024, corrupted files showed the following screen. In the next version 
corrupted files could still be scrolled to using the arrow keys, before the corrupted files 
seemingly disappeared from the folder.

After the update on 30/05/2024, the corrupted files became visible again, this time 
with arrows buttons and page numbers 1-5.
