## Document contents

>
> Meet Rebecca, the first of her kind. Jax Jackson goes under the hood... 
> Rebecca, a former terminally ill lab assistant at Arc/Hive found herself 
> thrust into the spotlight following her transformation via a cutting edge 
> SYNTH trial. Diagnosed with a degenerative neurological condition from 
> environmental toxins, Rebecca saw this experiment as her last hope. The 
> SYNTH trial was a remarkable success, seamlessly transferring her 
> conciousness into a synthetic body and greatly enhancing her capabilities. 
> Overnight, she became a symbol of scientific breakthrough and hope. 
> But with newfound fame came intense scrutiny.
>
> JAXON: Rebecca, you've become the face of NEX GEN, but isn't chain-smoking 
> a bit passé? At the TEKKA press event, you were puffing away like it was 2025.
>
> REBECCA: (nervous laughter) Yeah, I actually don't like smoking at all. 
> It was a marketing stunt by NEX GEN to showcase the invulnerability of 
> SYNTH bodies. They thought it would make a strong visual impact. Now, 
> it's just a habit, I guess.
>
> JAXON: Marketing, huh? So, you're basically a walking ad. Not exactly the 
> terminally ill girl you used to be. How did it feel, living with a death 
> sentence?
>
> REBECCA: It was... overwhelming. I had a degenerative neurological 
> condition from environmental toxins. They told me I had months left. 
> Every day was a struggle, knowing that my time was running out and there 
> was nothing I could do about it.
>
> JAXON: And now? You’re practically invincible. Ever thought about going 
> wild, maybe trying drugs, partying?
>
> REBECCA: (hesitates) That’s not really my thing. I wasn’t into that stuff 
> before, and I don’t see a reason to start now. My focus is on my work. 
>
> JAXON: Come on, everyone needs to cut loose sometimes. Ever been to one 
> of our legendary TEKKA parties? Trust me, they’re worth it.
> REBECCA: (smiles awkwardly) I’ve heard stories. Maybe I’ll attend one day, 
> but I’m still adjusting to all this.
>
> JAXON: Speaking of work, you’ve been promoted to managing the R&D team. 
> Quite the leap from where you started. How’s that going?
>
> REBECCA: It’s been a steep learning curve, but I’m managing. The team is 
> brilliant, and we’re making significant progress in several key areas.
>
> JAXON: Let’s talk about the big players here. What’s your take on Victor 
> Carmine? Some say he’s a visionary, others say he’s a bit of a psycho.
>
> REBECCA: Victor is… intense. He’s driven and has a clear vision for the 
> future. He made some controversial decisions, but his dedication to 
> advancing technology is undeniable.
>
> JAXON: And what about Dallus Lauren and Karl Strassman? Any juicy details 
> on them?
>
> REBECCA: They’re both incredibly intelligent and committed to their work. 
> I can’t really speak to their personal lives, though.
>
> JAXON: Come on, Rebecca. You must have heard something about the whole 
> MANTRA debacle and Operation Trinity. What’s the real story there?
>
> REBECCA: (firmly) I can’t discuss that. My focus is on the present and 
> our future projects.
>
> JAXON: Fair enough. But what about those rumors about extreme experiments 
> and human suffering? What’s really going on behind the scenes?...
