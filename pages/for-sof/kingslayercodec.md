# Kngsl@yer_EncrypMsg.codek

> Biohazard protocols are in effect.

The Kingslayer file opens to a puzzle you have to solve in 7:55 minutes, which then opens a password screen with a 30 seconds timer. 

The video is a brief radio call between "Spectre" and "Overwatch". They are following NYX 01 [(Selene)](../characters/selene) and NYX 02 [(Scott)](../characters/syko) closely before Spectre gets the FANTOM team to engage.

![Solution to the wire puzzle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmth-arg-wiki/wiki-assets/main/files/kingslayer_codek/kingslayer_codek_puzzle.png)

The following is the solution to the maze. To solve it yourself, you will need to beat the 
timer and click and rotate the pieces.
The pieces are always in the same order, making the strategy below the most viable.

1. Start at the top, the green line will connect and show you what is correct
2. Leave the first piece alone, but note the number it displays
3. Click each blue piece until it displays the number of the previous wire. 
4. Click it once more and rotate it into place.
5. Repeat for each wire.

Tip: you will need to click once for the first wire you connect, twice for the second, and this pattern 
continues until the end.
