## About

This file was hidden behind a music notes puzzle, released on the 4th of December along with three other puzzles 
and lots of new content. The file is the second [Grumblr](grumblr) post from [Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca) and 
details her work with [Strassman](../characters/strassman) and [Dallus Lauren](../characters/dallus-lauren), as well as 
an unpleasant encounter with [Skys](../characters/skys).
