The second [Grumblr](grumblr) post from [Rebecca Sinclair](../characters/rebecca). In this post, she speaks about

on the 5th of November 2036. She also meets Skys, who is transferred into a synth body 16 years after going into a coma 
in the final hours of the [October massacre](../lore/mantra).

> I don’t even know where to start. Today was my first day working with Dr. Strassman and Dr. Dallus Lauren on the 
> SYNTH project, and it was… well, way beyond anything I’d imagined. They told me this was going to be huge, like 
> life-changing science, but honestly, I don’t think anything could’ve prepared me for what I saw today.
>
> 
> This morning I was thrown face first into the project. Despite a whole spectrum of misery churning inside me lately, 
> I couldn't help feeling a little… excited?
>
> 
> By all accounts,  Dr. Karl Strassman is a revolutionary genius. And, like everyone else on the planet, I’ve known Dr. 
> Dallus Lauren’s name since he saved a good chunk of people living on it with the MOXY PAK. The man’s like a living legend. 
> It’s surreal working with him. With both of them.
>
>
> But actually meeting Dallus… It’s like he's barely holding it together. I knew about the car crash that had taken his daughter, 
> but that was years ago, before I even started with Arc/Hive. Still, he looks like he’s only half there, his face is hollow, distant. 
> He doesn’t make eye contact, barely even speaks.
>
> 
> He looks way older than he is, his movements are stiff, like some sad marionette being jerked around by an inattentive puppeteer. 
> It’s strange, and kind of unsettling, to watch someone who saved so many people look like he’s struggling to save himself.
>
> 
> Strassman, on the other hand, isn’t exactly what I’d imagined, He’s all smiles and quirks, but there’s something undeniably off 
> about him. His lab coat is a real state,  his breath smells faintly of something stronger than coffee,-
> -and his eyes, well lets just say they have the sleep-deprived glint of someone who gets into philosophical debates with their equipment.
>
>
> Nothing about this setup is protocol. Nothing about ths place follows any of the usual rules. First, they had me sign a 
> “Confidentiality and Compliance Agreement” with my own blood. Yeah, like some Ecliptist ritual. I swear, the red alarms 
> were already blaring in my mind. And then came the bombshell: Skys. He’s alive.
>
>
> Yes, that Skys. The “Brain Butcher,” the infamous leaser of MANTRA. The man who terrorised the world by pushing people 
> to transcendence through trauma, blood, and neural rewiring, People still talk about the horrors he inflicted like it 
> was some nightmare you couldn’t wake up from.
>
>
> They say he broke minds just to watch them unravel, that he turned people into experiments while they were still 
> breathing, all in the name of “evolution.” Skys was the kind of legend people used to scare their kids at night, 
> a boogeyman for the new age.
>
>
> And now here he is, breathing (barely) in the same building. Strassman explained he’s been in a coma since the final 
> hours of the October Massacre. He said there’s no way Skys is coming back “naturally,” that he’s suspended between 
> life and death, like a ghost trapped between worlds.
>
>
> My head was swimming as I tried to keep up, thoughts torn between ethical boundaries and this strange allure of a second chance.
> And the actual process. What a horror show. The way they stripped him down, like he wasn’t even human.
>
> 
> I had to stand there, keep it together, act like I was all in and didn’t feel like running for the door every five seconds. 
> Watching them upload Skys’s mind into this exoskeleton felt like a scene from a Mindflix sci-fi. And then,-
> -when his consciousness actually woke up inside that metal skeleton and started begging for death? 
> God, I’ll never get that sound out of my head.
>
>
> It was his laughter. A distorted metallic sound at first, which then turned into a scream, a howl of raw agony. 
> Then, the kind of silence that makes your skin crawl.
>
>
> “Kill me,” he whispered, barely audible, like it was speaking from a void.
>
>
> “Can you kill me? Please… I’m sorry… please.”
>
>
> “I promise I’ll be good. Just… kill me.”
>
>
> It was a voice of complete, unfiltered suffering.
>
>
> Dallus just sank to the floor, his back against the wall. Strassman grabbed a nearby bench, shaking his head in shock.
> I couldn’t even move, I just watched, numb, like I’d walked into someone else’s nightmare.
>
> 
> When Skys’ cried died down, Strassman turned to Dallus, trying to rationalise, to make sense of the horror we’d all 
> witnessed. He argued it wasn’t the procedure that caused this, it was Skys himself, his psyche shattered from years 
> trapped in a coma, suspended in darkness.
>
>
> Strassman was practically pleading with Dallus to see it as a side effect of “prolonged isolation,” a mind gone mad from too long in the void.
>
>
> But Dallus wasn’t having it.
>
>
> “Variables,” Dallus spat. He looked right at Strassman, his voice breaking as he shouted. “Let’s not sugarcoat it, 
> these aren’t variables, they’re cataclysms. The brain isn’t some playground for us to experiment on. 
> We’re treating it like some twisted game, and this… this is what we get.”
>
> 
> He paused, voice dropping to a whisper. “We’re playing god, Karl. And we’re losing.” The room fell silent. 
> I don’t know how long we stood there, the three of us frozen in our own ways, trying to process the horror we’d just seen.
>
> 
> Eventually, I couldn’t stand the silence anymore, so I cleared my throat. They both turned to me,-
> -and before I even knew what I was saying, the words were out.
>
>
> “I’ll do it.”
>
>
> What in oblivion was I thinking?
