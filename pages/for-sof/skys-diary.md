# Skys' Diary

{% include content/warning.html
title="Skys' Scrapbook"
content="This entry was first released in December 2024. After a change in the website, this original version of Skys' 
first diary entry was made inaccessible. You can find the updated app with multiple entries in the 
[Skys' Scrapbook app](../website/skys-diary) to continue his story."

> All I remember was the skys above me, watching me, like it was the only thing that didn’t look away.

In [Skys](../characters/skys)' scrapbook entry, we learn more about his early life. From the Unbeleevable episodes, we already 
knew that Skys was kicked out at a young age and that a man named Alby and his community took him in. The diary 
details what Skys went through during this period and how he came to be known as Skys.

> Found this book in a broken place. Thought I’d maybe write stuff down. Like anyone gonna care what I seen or what 
> I been. But got no one else to talk to,so I will talk to myself.
>
> 
> Don’t remember my name. Used to have one, I think. But no one called me it. Just other names. curse-child, bad blood, 
> devil’s spawn. Was born in a place called Novosovia. Cold place, cold all the time. People was colder. I was born with 
> pink hair. That was my first mistake in life. Lots of other kids got white hair. Said it was from something bad in the air. 
> white is bad too, but Pink is worse. Said I was touched by a demon. Said Im not a kid, just a curse.
>
> 
> My parents… tried to keep me hid at first. But… they never looked at me, never talked to me. Kept me shut away like 
> I was sick. Then, on my 8th birthday, they put me outside and never let me back in. I banged on the door, screamed, begged, 
> but they didn’t open it. After a while, I just stopped knocking.
> 
>
> Don’t know what I felt then. Weren’t cold like outside cold. Emptier, like when you don’t eat for days, but it’s in 
> your chest. eating me up from inside. So I kept to myself, finding scraps, hidin’ from people who’d look at me like 
> I was trash. I started thinking they was right.
>
> 
> I walked, kept walking, town to town, just me. Hoping one day I’d just disappear. Didn’t think anyone would care. 
> Didn’t know what it felt like to have someone care.
>

> Then one day, there was nowhere else to go. I got to the sea, just watching the water, thinkin’ maybe it should walk 
> into it. Hid on a big ship there, in a crate with boxes. Lived off crumbs, sometimes rats. Sometimes rats lived off me. 
> Sometimes rats lived off me. Only thing I could see for weeks was the skys through a crack in the box. All I remember 
> was the skys above me,watching me, like it was the only thing that didn’t look away. 
> So when I got to the new world, I told them my name was Skys.
>
> 
> I ended up in a place called Ingleterra. They was in war with Novosovia and a place real far called Colombia. 
> Ingleterra lost. Hard. Whole place looked like junk, streets all busted up, buildings falling down. 
> People wore scars like they was born with ‘em, faces all twisted up. The world felt like it was broke. 
> Then… I met them. The travellers.
>
> 
> They didn’t look at me like I was wrong or broken. Had a big fire going, laughing real loud at nothing. Singing songs. 
> Like they wasn’t in the same world as me, not even close. Said they followed somethin’ called Velama. 
> Said it was a way of life, or maybe more like a voice, one that came from deepinside. Said it told ‘em things, 
> how to see what’s hidden, how to feel what others can’t They called it the spirit of freedom, 
> like nothin’ could hold ‘em down.
>
>
> And they let me sit by the fire with ‘em. Didn’t push me off or spit. Didn’t yell. Just let me be there. Feels… weird.  
> Don’t got words for it. It’s like hot in my body, but it doesn’t hurt. Keeps me from being- [cuts off]
>
>
> Don’t know if I’ll stay. I’m scared they’ll turn on me, like all the rest. But for now… maybe I got somewhere to be.

## Password context

Originally, Skys' first diary page was located behind a locks puzzle, requiring careful lock-picking. The puzzle was 
later replaced by a new version of the same puzzle, this time unlocking the [M8 Museum](museum). As of november 2025, 
[Skys' diary](../website/skys-diary) is now an app on the dashboard. The puzzle in its original form is no longer accessible.
