> **COMMUNITY RESOURCE ANALOG PROGRAMMING**
> 
> **Lee [reading a book called 'How To Start A Cult']:** [unintelligible mumbling] 
>"I’ll be honest with you, I can see the appeal in being a cult leader. I mean, what’s not to like? Money? Just a bit. 
>Sex? Pwhoar. Drugs? Ooh ah. Sounds like a right laugh don’t you think? Well think again! 
>Cos if you want to be a modern day guru, you’re gonna have to work harder than a bloke with one leg in an arse-kicking contest."
>
>[Opening music plays]
>
>**Lee:** “Welcome back to Unbeleevable with me, Dr. Lee M.D. Where we’re delving back into the whacky world of GENXSIS. 
>In 2004, a young lad named Skys returns to his homeland of Novosovia with his new band. 
>They’re called Skys and the Starjammers, and they’re hot shit. 
>But before he found success, things were bleaker for Skys than a bog with no bog roll. 
>
>“Recovered pages of his journal detail how he legged it from Novosovia to escape persecution from his motherland. 
>He ends up in Inglaterra where he stumbles upon a bunch of seemingly kind-hearted travellers. 
>Apparently these bell-ends practiced an ancient order called the Law of Velama and even had magical powers. 
>It were a bit like Hogwarts if Gandalf was a nonce. 
>
>“You see, the groups leader, Alby, took a shine to Skys, 
>and let’s just say Alby was a bit too keen to show off his vanishing act (The dirty git). 
>Skys eventually snaps and kicks the shit out of him. (ooh, that’s gonna sting in the morning). 
>After that he does a runner and hides out in an abandoned asylum. 
>
>"He dies his hair black with toxic leech blood (as you do) to conceal his identity. 
>He gets off his head on drugs and winds up with chronic sleep paralysis. 
>He’s plagued by entities he calls mares. These things could make a grown man cry, uglier than a munter in the morning. 
>As you can imagine, after all that shite, Skys was a few eggs short of a benedict."
>
>[Cuts to footage from a 2004 interview of Skys:]
>
>EARLY ARCHIVE FOOTAGE OF SKYS
> 
>INGLATERRA, 2004
>
>**Interviewer:** “Tell me in a sentence who you are."
>
>**Skys:** [moves erratically while making noises] “I’m nobody.”
>
>[Cuts back to Lee:]
>
>**Lee:** [imitates Skys] “And even though most of Skys’ ramblings sounded like something you’d find written in shit on a looney bin wall, 
>one man was taking him seriously. 
>Novosovian scientist Dr. Karl Strassman, founder of Neurospiritualism and a grade A boffin. 
>It’s said Strassman caught an interview with Skys banging on about concepts that he’d only encountered in theoretical 
>physics and speculative discussion. 
>Yet, here was Skys, a man with no formal scientific training, espousing ideas that mirrored Strassman’s own cutting-edge research.
> 
>“Where others saw madness, Strassman saw potential; he had to meet him. 
>Strassman finds out Skys is back in Novosovia and secures a meeting. 
>He convinces his tech-wizard partner, Dr. Dallus Lauren to join him. 
>Hesitantly, he agrees. 
>
>"So picture this, it’s a dark and stormy night in a magical forest. 
>Under a pale moon, Strassburg, Dallus, and their assistant Ro meet up with Skys. 
>The scientists were thinking they’d just come for a chin wag, but Skys had other ideas. 
>Turns out he’s having a do at a historic building known as the October Palace.
>
>“But this weren’t your typical soirée, and although these nerds weren’t exactly gonna be getting a bag for the afters, 
>they agreed to attend. And I’ll tell you what, it was likea bloody fever dream. 
>Everyone was sniffed off their box, swinging off fxcking chandeliers, shagging about, and the rest. 
>It’s here Strassmn meets one of Skys lady friends, Ava."
> 
>**Someone of camera [in an american accent]:** "Ava." 
> 
> **Lee [mimicking the american accent]:** "Ava."
>
>**Lee [back to his regular british accent]:** "Ava’s calm confidence and otherworldly beauty were magnetic.
>“For Strassman, it was love at first sight (big mistake). While Strassman’s trying to get his willy wet, 
>Dallus has had enough and tries to do a runner. But before he can get to the door, Skys cuts him off and tells him he’s got something to show him. 
>Some accounts claim that Skys used the scientists assistant Ro to demonstrate that pain is a pathway to transcendence. 
>Or maybe he did what my Dad did to convince me he were magic [mimics finger magic trick].
>
>“Whatever he did, Strassman ate it up like a Maccys after an all night bender. 
>And even though the scientists thought Skys were a proper nobhead, after what they saw that night, they knew there were no going back. 
>
>"Now here where things get proper mental. These nutbars shattered the boundaries of human understanding. 
>Together they tore through the veil of reality itself, 
>fusing science and spirit into a single Earth-shaking revelation. 
>However, once the god bothering government of Novosovia heard this, they sayn none thing: nyet nyet." 
>
>[Cut to a woman on TV speaking Russian:]
>
>**Woman:** “This unholy trinity is defaming the ideals of our nation. 
>They’re threatening our God, religion, monarchy."
>
>[Cuts back to Lee:]
>
>**Lee:** “Still, even with the government painting Skys as a proper wrong’un, 
>his message of transcendence and hope was striking a chord with Novosovia’s young’uns. 
>To top it off, Skys was pumping in the club scene full of his own dodgy drug called MANTRA. 
>These bible bashing kids were suddenly meeting a new kind of God, getting a taste of Heaven on Earth and they were hungry for more. 
>And just like that, the cult of MANTRA was born. (ohh look, I’ve got pink hair again)
>
>“So, how the hell do you bring down a cult more powerful than the government? 
>From the Inside. Enter Medea. 
>That’s going to have to do, I need a shit.”

It's the sliders puzzle in the bottom right corner of the inventory. It shuffles, 
so sadly there is no one solution, but you can view the video on YouTube.
