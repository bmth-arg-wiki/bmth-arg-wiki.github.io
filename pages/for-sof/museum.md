# M8's VR Museum

M8's VR museum was released on the 30th of November 2025, hidden behind a second lock puzzle. 
The previous lock puzzle, hiding [Skys' diary](skys-diary), was replaced with this puzzle on 
the [website](../website/website). 

***

## Password Context

First we need to get into the museum. Open the locks puzzle from Sof's inventory. There is no password, 
but a minigame to pass.

1. Push the first four locks one by one until they spin with the first tool (medium-sized one)
2. Push the big lock until it spins with the second tool (big one)
3. Push the four smallest locks one by one until they spin on the right with the third tool (smallest one)

Tip: you have to be VERY gentle.

After completing the locks puzzle, you will have access to the museum. 
Clicking the lift at the back left activates a password pop-up.

The password is "selene". The items around the museum refer to the Post Human Prophecy (cover of 
[Post Human: Survival Horror](../music/ph-survival-horror)), which seems to be associated with our pink-haired 
characters (Skys, Selene & Sof), but the intended reasoning for this password is unknown.

## Museum Contents

### Main Area

The following items are in the museum, from the back left corner of the room:

- **Child's Drawings**: several drawings from Skys' diary.
- **Vintage Flyer**: a [Skys & the Starjammers poster](skystarjammers)
- **Newspaper**: [The Science Study newspaper](thesciencestudy)
- **Commemorative Statue (Date Unknown)**: a golden statue of the figure from the cover of Post Human: Survival Horror. 
The 3D model is the same as the [Survival Horror Tribute](survival-horror-anniversary). 
- **Post Human Survival Horror (October 2020)**: the album cover of [Post Human: SURVIVAL HORROR](../music/ph-survival-horror)
- **Post Human: Nex Gen (May 2024)**: the album cover of [Post Human: NeX GEn](../music/ph-nex-gen)
- **Ritual Artifacts**: several artifacts depicted on the cover of PH:SH and its tribute 3D model
- **Inia geoffrensis (Amazon River Dolphin)**: an endangered dolphin that is also referred to as "pink dolphin", that 
can also be found in the real world.
- **Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady Assumption and Saint Paul**: a 3D model of a real-life cathedral from Saõ Paulo.
- **Handroanthus albus (Ipê)**: a tree with golden leaves, also inspired by a real-life species.

### Past the elevator

Although it looks like we used an elevator, we actually step outside into a wooded area. There are some smaller golden trees, 
many barren trees and a larger golden tree ahead. Past the golden tree we find a ghost- or hologram-like appearance of 
[Selene](../characters/selene), with the lo-fi track canyoufeelmy<3.tmpx playing as we get closer. 
Selene is made of (multiple layers of) ASCII art and the screen turns white when we get too close to her.

A sequence briefly appears on the screen: `qwertylkjsa`. We will need this to unlock the final tab on 
[Victor's interview](carmine_interview).
