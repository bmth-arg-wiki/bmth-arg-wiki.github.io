## System Breach Email

If you followed the instructions in the past, you may have received the following response, 
warning you that this secret was not supposed to be discovered yet. The email address was 
confirmed by the official moderators to be a placeholder. While they are aware of the 
community figuring this out the intended way, they have asked us **not to email the 
placeholder address anymore**.

> *SYSTEM BREACH!* Re: [your email subject]

> It appears you've illicitly hacked into the M8 server to decode hidden

> You see, the whole idea of this program is to unravel the mysteries at

> So a friendly warning: your recent unauthorized access to our website

> If you continue to hack into the system, you'll be permanently blocked
