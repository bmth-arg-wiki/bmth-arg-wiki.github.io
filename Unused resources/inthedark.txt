We see a screen with some code, most of it is CSS for styling or lower level code. The 
words contained within seem irrelevant. We do see "virus spreading". Additionally, 
flashes on the screen seem to contain code documentation.

We then switch to a man in a bare room, sitting in a chair with a digital device on his 
right temple. Something else seems to be attached behind his left ear.
Before him are a set of screens. Since the room is so bare, they can very well be related 
to what is happening in his brain and his memories. The screens also show flashes of 
what we see happening in the video, indicating that they might be memories.

The man has a tear running down his face and is emotionally distressed. He is the 
stand-in for Oli's voice and mouths the lyrics throughout the video.

We see the first vague scene of what seems to be entities, possibly mutated, 
reaching out through what looks like partially see-through fabric. 
We see a thin creature with long arms and a tiny waist behind this fabric, as well as 
a pair of people. Sometimes the entities seem to scream.

Around 0:42 we see a girl holding a sparkler. Her hair is dark and very curly, 
the background is greenish and she is partially obscured by purple light. Later in the 
video we see her again with different lighting.

We also see shots of a woman in a suit, she appears to be wearing a little handcuff earring.

A little girl can be seen in the video, wearing two tiny yellow and red extensions. She 
is holding drawings, before a monster takes her away. We also see her on the screens 
and "BAD SIGNAL" flashes over them before she disappears from the screen.

There's a scene of fireworks, with a man and a woman in front of it. A quick flash on the 
screen says "CODE EXPANDING". After this we see a quick flash of a car crash, with another 
shot of the fireworks following.

we also have a shot of a hand in reddish-brown water, which is still somewhat transparent.
