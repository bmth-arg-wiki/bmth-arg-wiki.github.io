Good evening @everyone

As you know, our Earth has been ravaged following the terrible virus that spread like wildfire across our beautiful planet. However, we at NeX GEn dedicated ourselves to control, I mean rebuild society from the ashes. We have been able to go deeper than anyone else has before, and we have found salvation !

Thanks to a very willing subject named Selene, who was immune to the virus, we have been able to probe the innermost recesses of her mind. Within this domain, she found herself ensnared in a dreamscape beyond her wildest imagination. She named this place Youtopia, a domain accessible to every human, with definitely no side effects. if you, too, wish to access Youtopia, all you need to do is‚Ä¶

@everyone 

I got distracted by a new experiment before I could finish telling you all how to unlock Youtopia, but I‚Äôm back. 

The first step on your journey to Youtopia: Connection.

Connection is not just about forging bonds with others but also about developing a profound understanding of your own essence. In the journey towards Youtopia, Emily discovered that true connection starts from within. She encountered various versions of herself, each representing different facets of her personality and potential. Through this introspective exploration, she realised that love begins with self-love and acceptance.

To embrace this revelation, I invite you to:

Connect with Others: Join us in ‚Å†üîó„Éªconnection to share your experiences, ideas, and support. Building meaningful relationships is a cornerstone of our community.
Connect through Music: Music as an ultimate form of connection - Listening to BMTH tracks on Spotify will boost your XP gains as you climb the clergy on your way to Youtopia - The top 10 listeners each week will be granted a role to signify their musical connection.
Connect with Yourself: Take time for self-reflection and personal growth. Understand your strengths, embrace your flaws, and celebrate your unique journey.

By mastering the revelation of Connection, you lay the foundation for accessing Youtopia, where every individual's potential is unlocked through deep, meaningful connections both internally and externally.

Let's come together to create a supportive and compassionate community, where each member can thrive and grow.
